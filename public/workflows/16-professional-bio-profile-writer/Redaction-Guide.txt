PROFESSIONAL BIO & PROFILE WRITER - REDACTION GUIDE
=====================================================

PURPOSE
This guide outlines the data types that must be redacted or handled with care when
creating professional biographies and profile content. Bios often contain a high
density of personal information, making redaction discipline critical.

DATA TYPES TO REDACT
=====================

ALWAYS REDACT (Never include in AI prompts or drafts):
- Home address or personal mailing address
- Personal phone number (use business number only)
- Social Security Number or government ID numbers
- Personal email address (use professional/business email)
- Financial information (salary, net worth, investment details)
- Medical or health information
- Family member names, ages, or details (unless explicitly authorized)
- Passwords, login credentials, or access tokens
- Private legal matters (lawsuits, settlements, disputes)

REDACT UNLESS EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED BY SUBJECT:
- Age or date of birth
- Religious or political affiliations
- Marital or relationship status
- Ethnic or racial identity
- Disability status
- Home neighborhood or city of residence
- Names of minor children
- Details about personal hardships or challenges
- Membership in private organizations
- Volunteer work at sensitive organizations (shelters, crisis centers)

HANDLE WITH CARE (Include only when professionally relevant):
- Previous employer names (check for NDA restrictions)
- Revenue or financial metrics from previous roles (verify disclosure permissions)
- Client names (check confidentiality agreements)
- Project details from previous employment
- Patent or IP information
- Board memberships or advisory roles

STEP-BY-STEP REDACTION PROCESS
==============================

Step 1: Pre-Input Review
Before entering any information into the workflow or AI tool:
- Review the source document (resume, CV, intake form) line by line
- Highlight any items from the "Always Redact" list
- Flag any items from the "Redact Unless Authorized" list
- Confirm with the subject which flagged items are approved for inclusion

Step 2: Create a Sanitized Input Document
- Copy the source document
- Replace all "Always Redact" items with generic placeholders:
  * [PHONE REDACTED]
  * [ADDRESS REDACTED]
  * [PERSONAL EMAIL REDACTED]
- Remove or replace "Redact Unless Authorized" items per subject instructions
- Use this sanitized version as your workflow input

Step 3: During Drafting
- Work only from the sanitized input document
- Do not reference the original unsanitized document during AI interactions
- If the AI tool requests additional personal information, provide only
  what has been pre-approved
- Do not paste full resumes with contact headers into AI tools

Step 4: Output Review
- Before sharing any draft, scan for accidentally included PII
- Check that no redacted information "leaked" through AI inference
  (e.g., AI guessing a location from company name)
- Verify that hyperlinks do not expose personal pages or profiles
  not intended for public association

Step 5: Final Sanitization
- Run a final check on all bio versions before delivery
- Confirm that only approved personal information appears
- Ensure no metadata in exported files contains hidden PII

SCENARIO 1: Executive Bio for Public Website
=============================================
A VP of Engineering provides their resume for a company website bio. The resume
includes their home address, personal cell phone, a reference to a medical leave,
and their children's school names in a volunteer section.

Redaction Actions:
- Remove home address entirely (not relevant to bio)
- Replace personal cell with company contact or "Contact via [COMPANY]"
- Remove medical leave reference completely
- Remove children's school names; if volunteer work is relevant, generalize to
  "volunteers with local educational organizations"
- Confirm with the VP whether to include specific revenue metrics from their
  previous company (potential NDA concern)

SCENARIO 2: Speaker Bio for Industry Conference
================================================
A consultant submits a bio for a conference. The bio draft includes their age,
a reference to their divorce inspiring their career change, a client list that
includes Fortune 500 companies, and their home city.

Redaction Actions:
- Remove age (not relevant; can introduce bias)
- Remove divorce reference unless the consultant explicitly wants it included
  as part of their professional narrative
- Review client list against NDAs; replace specific names with "Fortune 500
  clients in the technology and healthcare sectors" if not authorized
- Home city: include only if professionally relevant (e.g., "based in Austin, TX"
  for a regional consultant); otherwise omit

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
