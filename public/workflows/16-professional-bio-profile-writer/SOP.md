# Professional Bio & Profile Writer - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview and Objectives

The Professional Bio & Profile Writer workflow provides a structured system for crafting compelling professional biographies, executive summaries, and platform-specific profile content. Whether for LinkedIn, company websites, conference speaker pages, or internal directories, this workflow guides users through extracting key career highlights, aligning tone to audience expectations, and producing polished biographical content that positions subjects effectively.

Professional bios are often the first impression a person makes in digital and print contexts. A poorly written or outdated bio can undermine credibility, while a strategically crafted one opens doors to opportunities, partnerships, and trust. This workflow ensures consistency, appropriate tone calibration, and completeness across every bio produced.

By following this SOP, users will develop the skill to rapidly produce bios for multiple contexts from a single intake of professional information, reducing redundant effort and ensuring brand alignment across all platforms.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Transform raw career information into polished, audience-appropriate biographical content
- Provide tone and length calibration for different platforms (LinkedIn, website, conference, internal)
- Ensure all bios include measurable achievements and credibility markers
- Maintain consistency across multiple bio versions for the same individual
- Enable rapid iteration from a single source-of-truth document

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Platform-ready biographical content in 3+ length variants (50-word, 150-word, 300-word)
- Tone-matched profiles for professional, conversational, and formal contexts
- A reusable career highlights inventory for future bio updates
- Increased engagement and response rates on professional platforms
- Reduced turnaround time for bio requests from days to under 30 minutes

**W.E.D.G.E Framework Integration:**
- **Workflow**: Systematizes bio creation from intake questionnaire through drafting, tone adjustment, and multi-platform export, eliminating ad-hoc writing
- **Education**: Teaches users what makes bios effective — achievement framing, audience targeting, and the psychology of first impressions
- **Data**: All personal career data, employment history, and identifying details are handled with strict redaction protocols; no PII is stored beyond the session
- **Guidance**: Provides proven bio frameworks (PAR method, STAR adaptation for bios, platform-specific best practices)
- **Empowerment**: After repeated use, users internalize bio-writing principles and can draft without the workflow

## Prerequisites
- Subject's current resume or CV (PDF or text)
- List of target platforms (LinkedIn, company website, conference program, etc.)
- Desired tone preferences (formal, conversational, authoritative, approachable)
- Any brand guidelines or style guides that apply
- 2-3 example bios the subject admires or wants to emulate

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Career Information Intake (10-15 minutes)
Gather all raw professional information from the subject before any writing begins.

- [ ] Collect current resume/CV and review for completeness
- [ ] Identify the subject's current role, title, and organization
- [ ] List top 5 career achievements with quantifiable metrics where possible
- [ ] Document educational credentials, certifications, and notable affiliations
- [ ] Record any personal interests or values the subject wants included
- [ ] Note any information the subject explicitly wants excluded
- [ ] Confirm the subject's preferred name and pronouns for written content

### Step 2: Audience & Platform Analysis (5-10 minutes)
Define who will read each bio version and what action you want them to take.

- [ ] List all platforms where the bio will appear
- [ ] Define the primary audience for each platform (recruiters, clients, peers, general public)
- [ ] Determine the desired reader action (connect, hire, book as speaker, trust as expert)
- [ ] Research character/word limits for each platform
- [ ] Identify 2-3 competitor or peer bios on each platform for benchmarking

### Step 3: Highlights Extraction & Achievement Framing (10-15 minutes)
Transform raw career data into compelling achievement statements.

- [ ] Convert job duties into outcome-oriented achievement statements
- [ ] Apply the PAR method (Problem-Action-Result) to top 5 achievements
- [ ] Rank achievements by relevance to each target audience
- [ ] Identify unique differentiators that separate the subject from peers
- [ ] Draft a single compelling opening sentence that captures the subject's professional identity

### Step 4: Multi-Version Drafting (15-20 minutes)
Create bio variants tailored to each platform and length requirement.

- [ ] Draft the micro bio (50 words) — elevator pitch format
- [ ] Draft the short bio (150 words) — conference program / social media format
- [ ] Draft the standard bio (300 words) — website / professional directory format
- [ ] Draft the extended bio (500+ words) — detailed speaker page or "About" page format
- [ ] Adjust tone for each version: formal for corporate, conversational for social media
- [ ] Ensure each version can stand alone without requiring the others for context
- [ ] Verify that key achievements appear in all versions, scaled to length

### Step 5: Review, Refinement & Export (10-15 minutes)
Polish all versions and prepare for deployment.

- [ ] Read each bio aloud to check for natural flow and rhythm
- [ ] Verify all factual claims (dates, titles, company names, metrics)
- [ ] Run a consistency check across all versions for conflicting information
- [ ] Check for jargon that may not translate across audiences
- [ ] Format each bio for its target platform (markdown, plain text, HTML)
- [ ] Obtain subject approval on all versions before publishing

## Best Practices
1. Always lead with the most impressive or relevant credential for the target audience
2. Use active voice and strong verbs — "led," "built," "transformed" instead of "was responsible for"
3. Include at least one quantifiable achievement in every bio version, even the shortest
4. Write in third person for formal bios and first person for conversational platforms
5. Keep sentences short — aim for 15-20 words per sentence in bios
6. Avoid cliches like "passionate," "results-driven," or "thought leader" without substantiation
7. Update bios quarterly or whenever a significant career milestone occurs
8. Maintain a master bio document from which all versions are derived
9. Test bios with someone unfamiliar with the subject to verify clarity
10. Include a human element — a brief personal detail makes bios memorable

## Common Pitfalls
1. **Listing duties instead of achievements** — Solution: Apply the PAR method to every bullet; if it does not show impact, rewrite it
2. **One-size-fits-all approach** — Solution: Always create platform-specific versions; a LinkedIn summary is not a conference bio
3. **Outdated information** — Solution: Set calendar reminders for quarterly bio reviews
4. **Overuse of buzzwords** — Solution: Replace every adjective with a specific example or metric
5. **Too long for the platform** — Solution: Draft at the required length, do not truncate a longer version
6. **Missing call to action** — Solution: Every bio should implicitly or explicitly suggest a next step (connect, visit, contact)
7. **Inconsistent information across platforms** — Solution: Always update the master document first, then propagate changes
8. **Neglecting SEO for digital platforms** — Solution: Include relevant keywords naturally for LinkedIn and website bios

## Time Estimates
- Initial Setup: 15 minutes (intake questionnaire and platform research)
- Per-use: 30-45 minutes (full cycle from intake to export)
- Monthly review: 10 minutes (check for needed updates across platforms)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All target platforms have a bio version at the correct length
- [ ] Each bio leads with the strongest credential for its audience
- [ ] At least one quantifiable achievement appears in every version
- [ ] Tone is appropriately calibrated for each platform
- [ ] No factual inconsistencies exist across bio versions
- [ ] Subject has reviewed and approved all versions
- [ ] Bios are formatted correctly for each deployment platform
- [ ] A master bio document is saved for future updates
- [ ] Personal/human element is included in at least the standard and extended versions
- [ ] All PII has been handled according to the Redaction Guide

## Educational Disclaimer
This workflow provides guidance for creating professional biographical content. It is intended as an educational framework and does not guarantee specific outcomes such as job offers, speaking invitations, or business development results. Users should verify all factual claims independently and ensure compliance with their organization's communications policies. The quality of output depends on the accuracy and completeness of input provided.
