USAGE GUIDELINES
================

1. Always complete the Career Information Intake (SOP Step 1) before using any prompt. The quality of AI-generated bios is directly proportional to the specificity of inputs.

2. Replace ALL bracketed fields with real information. Leaving placeholders produces generic, unusable output.

3. For best results, provide actual metrics and numbers in achievement fields. "Increased revenue by 40% over 18 months" will always produce better bio content than "grew revenue significantly."

4. Run the output through the QC Checklist before publishing. AI-generated bios should always be fact-checked and tone-verified.

5. Use Prompt 4 (Multi-Length Bio Set) as your starting point for new subjects. Individual prompts work best for updates or platform-specific needs.

6. When using Prompt 9 (Bio Update), always paste the complete existing bio. Partial inputs lead to inconsistent updates.

7. Review the Redaction Guide before inputting any personal information. Remove sensitive details (home address, personal phone, private affiliations) before pasting into any AI tool.

8. Iterate at least twice. Use the first output as a draft, then refine with specific feedback about tone, emphasis, or missing elements.

9. Store final approved versions in a master document for future reference and consistency maintenance.

10. Revisit bios quarterly using Prompt 9 to ensure they reflect current roles, achievements, and strategic positioning.
