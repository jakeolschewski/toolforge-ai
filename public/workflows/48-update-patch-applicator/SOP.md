# Update Patch Applicator - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview and Objectives

The Update Patch Applicator workflow provides a systematic, W.E.D.G.E.-framework approach to update patch applicator. This workflow transforms ad-hoc approaches into repeatable, quality-assured processes that deliver consistent results while maintaining privacy and compliance standards.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Establish a structured process for update patch applicator
- Apply W.E.D.G.E. principles for quality and compliance
- Create reusable templates and frameworks
- Build measurable improvement over time
- Enable team adoption and collaboration

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Consistent, professional-quality outputs
- 40-60% time savings compared to ad-hoc approaches
- Documented processes for team scaling
- Privacy-compliant outputs ready for sharing
- Continuous improvement through feedback loops

**W.E.D.G.E Framework Integration:**
- **Workflow**: Systematizes update patch applicator into repeatable steps
- **Education**: Builds understanding of best practices and frameworks
- **Data**: Ensures privacy-safe handling of all inputs and outputs
- **Guidance**: Provides clear decision criteria and quality standards
- **Empowerment**: Enables autonomous execution with confidence

## Prerequisites

- Access to an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Relevant input materials for the workflow
- Note-taking or document creation tool
- 30-60 minutes for initial setup
- Basic familiarity with the subject area

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Gather and Prepare Inputs (5-10 minutes)

1. [ ] Collect all relevant source materials
2. [ ] Review materials for completeness
3. [ ] Redact any sensitive information before AI processing
4. [ ] Define the desired output format and quality standards
5. [ ] Set up your workspace and tools

**Output:** Organized, redacted input materials ready for processing

---

### Step 2: Analyze and Structure (10-15 minutes)

1. [ ] Use AI to analyze input materials for key themes and patterns
2. [ ] Create an outline or framework for the output
3. [ ] Identify gaps in information that need addressing
4. [ ] Organize content into logical sections
5. [ ] Validate structure against best practices

**Output:** Structured outline with identified gaps

---

### Step 3: Generate and Draft (10-15 minutes)

1. [ ] Use AI prompts to generate initial draft content
2. [ ] Review each section for accuracy and relevance
3. [ ] Customize AI output with personal expertise and context
4. [ ] Ensure consistency in tone, style, and terminology
5. [ ] Add specific examples and actionable details

**Output:** Complete first draft

---

### Step 4: Review and Refine (5-10 minutes)

1. [ ] Review against quality checklist criteria
2. [ ] Check for accuracy and factual correctness
3. [ ] Verify all privacy redaction is properly applied
4. [ ] Optimize for clarity and conciseness
5. [ ] Get peer review if available

**Output:** Refined, quality-checked output

---

### Step 5: Export and Document (5 minutes)

1. [ ] Export in the desired format
2. [ ] Save to appropriate location with clear naming
3. [ ] Document any decisions or customizations made
4. [ ] Set up review/update schedule
5. [ ] Share with relevant stakeholders

**Output:** Final deliverable ready for use

## Best Practices

1. Always redact sensitive information before using AI tools
2. Start with the provided templates and customize for your needs
3. Review AI outputs critically — verify facts and figures independently
4. Build a personal library of effective prompts for this workflow
5. Schedule regular reviews to keep your approach current
6. Document your customizations for team consistency
7. Track time savings to measure and demonstrate ROI
8. Iterate based on feedback — the first version is never the last
9. Maintain version history for accountability and learning
10. Share successful approaches with your team to multiply impact

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Skipping the preparation step**: Rushing to AI without organizing inputs produces poor outputs
   - *Solution:* Spend 5-10 minutes on preparation — it saves 30+ minutes in revisions

2. **Trusting AI output without verification**: AI can generate plausible but incorrect content
   - *Solution:* Always fact-check key claims and figures against reliable sources

3. **Not redacting sensitive data**: Pasting confidential info into AI tools creates privacy risks
   - *Solution:* Apply redaction guide before every AI interaction

4. **One-and-done approach**: Using the workflow once without iteration limits quality
   - *Solution:* Plan for at least 2 passes — draft then refine

5. **Over-engineering the process**: Making the workflow too complex for the task at hand
   - *Solution:* Scale the process to match the stakes — not every email needs 10 steps

6. **Ignoring the QC checklist**: Skipping quality checks leads to inconsistent outputs
   - *Solution:* Use the checklist every time until quality becomes automatic

7. **Working in isolation**: Not leveraging team knowledge and perspectives
   - *Solution:* Share outputs for peer review when possible

8. **Not updating templates**: Using outdated templates as tools and best practices evolve
   - *Solution:* Schedule quarterly template reviews and updates

## Time Estimates

- **Initial Setup:** 30-60 minutes (first time with template customization)
- **Per Use:** 20-45 minutes depending on complexity
- **Monthly Review:** 15-30 minutes for template and process updates

## Success Criteria

You've successfully implemented this workflow when:

- [ ] Process is repeatable and documented
- [ ] Quality standards are consistently met
- [ ] Privacy redaction is applied to all shared materials
- [ ] Templates are customized for your specific needs
- [ ] Time savings are measurable (target: 40-60%)
- [ ] Team members can execute independently (if applicable)
- [ ] Feedback loop established for continuous improvement
- [ ] Review cycle scheduled and maintained
