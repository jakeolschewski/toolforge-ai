DECISION MATRIX FOR PROJECT PRIORITIZATION - PROMPT VARIATIONS
===============================================================

PROMPT 1 - DECISION MATRIX BUILDER
-----------------------------------
Build a decision matrix for prioritizing the following projects. For each project, I need to evaluate it against weighted criteria and produce a ranked priority list.

Projects to evaluate:
[LIST YOUR PROJECTS - e.g., "Website redesign, Mobile app launch, CRM migration, Employee training program, Data warehouse build"]

Context:
- Decision type: [SELECTION / SEQUENCING / RESOURCE ALLOCATION - e.g., "Select top 3 to fund this quarter"]
- Constraint: [BUDGET / TIME / HEADCOUNT - e.g., "$200K budget for Q3"]
- Time horizon: [THIS QUARTER / THIS YEAR / NEXT 3 YEARS]
- Number of projects to select: [NUMBER or "rank all"]

For each project, generate:
1. A brief description (1-2 sentences)
2. Suggested evaluation criteria (4-6 criteria appropriate for these projects)
3. Recommended weights for each criterion (totaling 100%)
4. A blank scoring matrix I can fill in
5. Instructions for interpreting results


PROMPT 2 - CRITERIA SCORING ASSISTANT
--------------------------------------
Help me score projects against specific criteria. For each project-criterion pair, suggest a score and explain why.

Criteria and weights:
- [CRITERION 1]: [WEIGHT] - [DEFINITION - e.g., "Impact (30%) - Expected revenue or strategic value generated"]
- [CRITERION 2]: [WEIGHT] - [DEFINITION - e.g., "Effort (20%) - Resources required in person-months and dollars"]
- [CRITERION 3]: [WEIGHT] - [DEFINITION]
- [CRITERION 4]: [WEIGHT] - [DEFINITION]
- [CRITERION 5]: [WEIGHT] - [DEFINITION]

Scoring scale: [1-5 / 1-10]

Project to score:
- Name: [PROJECT NAME]
- Description: [BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
- Available data: [ANY METRICS, ESTIMATES, OR CONTEXT - e.g., "Estimated 15% revenue increase, 6-month timeline, requires 3 FTEs"]

For each criterion, provide:
1. Suggested score with reasoning
2. Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
3. What additional data would improve the score
4. Comparison notes (how this compares to typical projects)


PROMPT 3 - CUSTOM CRITERIA PRIORITIZER
---------------------------------------
Help me prioritize projects based on custom criteria specific to my situation.

My situation:
- Industry: [YOUR INDUSTRY - e.g., "SaaS startup, healthcare, education"]
- Stage: [EARLY-STAGE / GROWTH / MATURE / TURNAROUND]
- Primary goal: [GROWTH / PROFITABILITY / EFFICIENCY / COMPLIANCE / INNOVATION]
- Key constraint: [BUDGET / TIME / TALENT / TECHNOLOGY / REGULATORY]
- Team size: [NUMBER OF PEOPLE AVAILABLE]

Projects:
[LIST YOUR PROJECTS WITH BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS]

Based on my context:
1. Recommend 4-6 criteria tailored to my industry and stage
2. Suggest appropriate weights reflecting my primary goal and constraints
3. Define scoring anchors for each criterion (what does 1 vs. 5 mean?)
4. Score each project and explain the reasoning
5. Identify which criteria are most differentiating for my specific projects
6. Flag any criteria I should consider but may have overlooked


PROMPT 4 - MATRIX VISUALIZATION AND TABLE BUILDER
--------------------------------------------------
Create a visual decision matrix table for the following scored projects. I need this formatted for easy comprehension and presentation.

Projects and scores:
[PASTE YOUR PROJECT NAMES AND RAW SCORES - e.g.:
"Project A: Impact 8, Effort 3, Alignment 7, Risk 4, Urgency 6
Project B: Impact 5, Effort 7, Alignment 9, Risk 2, Urgency 8
Project C: Impact 9, Effort 2, Alignment 6, Risk 6, Urgency 3"]

Criteria weights:
[LIST WEIGHTS - e.g., "Impact 30%, Effort 20%, Alignment 20%, Risk 15%, Urgency 15%"]

Please generate:
1. A formatted table with raw scores, weighted scores, and totals
2. A ranked list with tier assignments (High / Medium / Low priority)
3. A text-based 2x2 matrix (Impact vs. Effort quadrant view)
4. Key insights from the scoring (strongest project, closest race, biggest surprise)
5. A summary suitable for copying into a presentation slide


PROMPT 5 - RISK-ADJUSTED PRIORITIZER
--------------------------------------
Adjust my project priority matrix to account for risk factors. I have an existing priority ranking and need to stress-test it against potential risks.

Current priority ranking:
[LIST YOUR RANKED PROJECTS - e.g.:
"1. Project A (Score: 85)
2. Project B (Score: 78)
3. Project C (Score: 72)
4. Project D (Score: 65)"]

Risk factors to consider:
- [RISK 1 - e.g., "Key developer might leave in Q2"]
- [RISK 2 - e.g., "Vendor dependency on a single supplier"]
- [RISK 3 - e.g., "Regulatory changes expected in 6 months"]
- [RISK 4 - e.g., "Market competitor launching similar product"]

For each project, provide:
1. Risk exposure assessment (which risks affect this project and how severely)
2. Risk-adjusted score (original score modified by risk factors)
3. Recommended mitigations for top risks
4. Revised ranking after risk adjustment
5. Sensitivity analysis: which risks, if they materialized, would change the top pick?


PROMPT 6 - TEAM DECISION MATRIX FACILITATOR
--------------------------------------------
Help me design and facilitate a team decision matrix exercise. I need a structured process that multiple team members can participate in fairly.

Team details:
- Number of participants: [NUMBER - e.g., "5 team members"]
- Roles represented: [LIST ROLES - e.g., "Engineering lead, Product manager, Designer, Marketing, Finance"]
- Decision-making style: [CONSENSUS / MAJORITY VOTE / ADVISORY (one person decides)]
- Known dynamics: [ANY RELEVANT CONTEXT - e.g., "Engineering and Product often disagree on priorities"]

Projects to evaluate: [NUMBER - e.g., "8 projects"]
Time available: [TOTAL TIME - e.g., "90-minute meeting"]

Generate:
1. Meeting agenda with time allocations for each step
2. Facilitation script (what to say at each stage)
3. Rules of engagement to prevent bias and groupthink
4. Individual scoring template for each participant
5. Aggregation method for combining individual scores
6. Discussion guide for resolving scoring discrepancies
7. Decision documentation template
8. Follow-up action items template


PROMPT 7 - MATRIX EXPORT AND SHEET BUILDER
--------------------------------------------
Help me create a professional decision matrix spreadsheet that I can use and share. Generate the complete structure and formulas.

Requirements:
- Number of projects: [NUMBER - e.g., "10"]
- Number of criteria: [NUMBER - e.g., "6"]
- Scoring scale: [SCALE - e.g., "1-5"]
- Number of raters: [NUMBER - e.g., "1 (solo)" or "4 (team)"]
- Export format: [GOOGLE SHEETS / EXCEL / NOTION / CSV]

Generate:
1. Complete sheet layout with headers, rows, and columns
2. All formulas needed (weighted scores, totals, ranks, averages)

6. Chart recommendations (which charts to create and how)
7. Instructions tab for new users
8. Print-friendly formatting specifications


PROMPT 8 - RETROSPECTIVE DECISION REVIEWER
--------------------------------------------
Help me review a past prioritization decision to learn from it and improve future decision-making.

Original decision:
- Date of decision: [WHEN - e.g., "Q1 2025"]
- Projects selected: [WHICH PROJECTS WERE CHOSEN]
- Projects deferred: [WHICH WERE NOT CHOSEN]
- Criteria used: [WHAT CRITERIA WERE EVALUATED]
- Decision method: [HOW WAS THE DECISION MADE - e.g., "Decision matrix", "Executive judgment", "Team vote"]

Actual outcomes:
- Selected projects: [WHAT HAPPENED - e.g., "Project A delivered on time, 12% revenue lift. Project B was cancelled at 60% completion."]
- Deferred projects: [WHAT HAPPENED - e.g., "Project C was picked up by a competitor. Project D is still waiting."]
- Surprises: [ANYTHING UNEXPECTED - e.g., "Project B's technology didn't work as expected"]

Analyze:
1. How accurate were the original priority scores vs. actual outcomes?
2. Which criteria best predicted success? Which were misleading?
3. Were there warning signs that were missed?
4. What criteria should be added or removed for next time?
5. How should weights be adjusted based on this experience?
6. Specific recommendations for the next prioritization cycle


PROMPT 9 - LARGE-SCALE PRIORITIZATION FRAMEWORK
-------------------------------------------------
Help me scale a decision matrix approach for a large number of projects. I need a phased approach that remains manageable.

Scale:
- Total projects to evaluate: [NUMBER - e.g., "50+ project proposals"]
- Decision-makers: [NUMBER - e.g., "12 people across 4 departments"]
- Budget to allocate: [AMOUNT - e.g., "$2M annual project budget"]
- Desired output: [WHAT YOU NEED - e.g., "Funded project portfolio for fiscal year"]

Challenges:
- [CHALLENGE 1 - e.g., "Too many projects for a single scoring session"]
- [CHALLENGE 2 - e.g., "Cross-department projects are hard to compare"]
- [CHALLENGE 3 - e.g., "Some projects are mandatory (compliance) vs. discretionary"]

Generate:
1. A phased approach (pre-filter, category scoring, cross-category ranking)
2. Category definitions for grouping similar projects
3. Mandatory vs. discretionary project handling rules
4. Cross-department calibration process
5. Governance structure (who decides what at each phase)
6. Timeline for the full prioritization cycle
7. Communication plan for announcing results
8. Tools and templates needed at each phase


PROMPT 10 - GOAL-ALIGNED PRIORITIZATION
-----------------------------------------
Help me align my project prioritization with specific strategic goals, OKRs, or organizational objectives.

Strategic goals:
- [GOAL 1 - e.g., "Increase ARR by 40% (OKR)"]
- [GOAL 2 - e.g., "Reduce customer churn below 5% (OKR)"]
- [GOAL 3 - e.g., "Launch in 2 new markets (strategic initiative)"]
- [GOAL 4 - e.g., "Achieve SOC 2 compliance (mandatory)"]

Projects:
[LIST YOUR PROJECTS WITH BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS]

Generate:
1. A goal-project alignment matrix (which projects support which goals)
2. Goal coverage analysis (are any goals under-served by current projects?)
3. Recommended criteria and weights derived from these specific goals
4. Scored matrix with goal-alignment as the primary lens
5. Gap analysis: what projects are missing to fully achieve each goal?
6. Recommendation: optimal project portfolio to maximize goal achievement
7. Trade-off analysis: what goals are sacrificed if budget is constrained?
8. Suggested KPIs for each selected project linked to the relevant goal

USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

PRIVACY PROTECTION:
When using these prompts, NEVER include:
- Confidential project codenames or internal initiative names
- Specific budget figures if proprietary
- Employee names in scoring or rationale
- Client or customer names
- Proprietary business metrics or revenue figures
- Competitive intelligence or market-sensitive plans

Use placeholders:
- "Project A", "Project B" instead of real project names if sensitive
- "Initiative Alpha", "Initiative Beta" for codenames
- Relative figures ("$X", "2x current budget") instead of exact amounts
- "Team Lead", "Stakeholder 1" instead of names

AI TOOL COMPATIBILITY:
These prompts work with all major AI assistants:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- Use with privacy-respecting settings (opt-out of training)

PROMPT CHAINING:
Recommended sequence for complete prioritization:
1. Start with Prompt 1 (Matrix Builder) or Prompt 3 (Custom Criteria)
2. Use Prompt 2 (Scoring Assistant) for each project
3. Follow with Prompt 4 (Visualization) to format results
4. Apply Prompt 5 (Risk Adjustment) for stress testing
5. Use Prompt 10 (Goal Alignment) to verify strategic fit
6. Finish with Prompt 7 (Export) to create shareable deliverables
7. Later, use Prompt 8 (Retrospective) to improve future cycles

FOR TEAM EXERCISES:
1. Start with Prompt 6 (Team Facilitator) to design the session
2. Use Prompt 1 or Prompt 3 to establish criteria collaboratively
3. Have individuals use Prompt 2 independently for scoring
4. Aggregate with Prompt 4 and discuss

FOR LARGE ORGANIZATIONS:
1. Begin with Prompt 9 (Large-Scale Framework) for the overall process
2. Use Prompt 10 (Goal Alignment) to set strategic context
3. Apply Prompt 3 per department or category
4. Consolidate with Prompt 4 and Prompt 7

ITERATION:
If outputs aren't specific enough:
- "Make the criteria more specific to [your industry]"
- "Provide more granular scoring anchors for [specific criterion]"
- "Add quantitative benchmarks for scoring"
- "Adjust weights to reflect [specific constraint or priority]"

SAVING OUTPUTS:
Keep all AI-generated matrices and rationale:
- Store in version-controlled shared drive
- Archive each scoring session with date and participants
- Maintain a library of criteria sets for different decision types
- Track decisions and outcomes for retrospective analysis

VERIFICATION:
Always independently verify:
- That criteria are appropriate for your specific context
- That weights reflect actual organizational priorities (not just what sounds balanced)
- That scores are supported by evidence, not just AI suggestions
- That the final ranking passes a common-sense check
