- Purpose/use case
- Current storage location
- Permissions/scope
- Creation date
- Last rotation date
- Risk level (high/medium/low)
- Recommended actions

Services I currently use:
[LIST YOUR SERVICES - e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Cloud, etc.]

Format as a table that I can copy to a spreadsheet.


PROMPT 2 - SECURITY RISK ASSESSMENT

- Last security incident: [Never, describe if any]

Provide:
1. Overall risk score (1-10, where 10 is highest risk)
2. Top 3 vulnerabilities in my current approach
3. Prioritized action plan to reduce risk
4. Quick wins (can implement in < 30 minutes)

Current setup: [How you currently use the key]
Environment: [Development, staging, production, or all]
Deployment method: [Manual, CI/CD, container orchestration, etc.]

Generate a rotation checklist including:
1. Pre-rotation preparation steps
2. Key generation steps (service-specific)
3. Testing procedures (staging first)
4. Production deployment steps
5. Verification steps
6. Rollback plan if issues occur
7. Old key revocation steps
8. Documentation/logging requirements

Make it copy-paste ready as a checklist I can follow.


PROMPT 5 - INCIDENT RESPONSE PLAYBOOK

8. Security best practices specific to my stack


PROMPT 7 - ACCESS CONTROL POLICY GENERATOR
-------------------------------------------
Help me create an access control policy for API credentials in my organization:

Organization details:
- Team structure: [Describe roles: developers, contractors, admins, etc.]
- Environments: [Development, staging, production]

==============================================================================
USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

PRIVACY PROTECTION:
When using these prompts, NEVER include:
- Actual API keys (even partial keys beyond last 4 characters)
- Full URLs with embedded credentials
- Access tokens or passwords
- Specific IP addresses or server names
- Customer or client data
- Proprietary architecture details

Use placeholders:
- "Service A", "Service B" instead of real service names if sensitive
- "Key ending in ...1234" instead of actual keys
- Generic descriptions of usage patterns

AI TOOL COMPATIBILITY:
These prompts work with all major AI assistants:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- Use with privacy-respecting settings (opt-out of training)

PROMPT CHAINING:
Recommended sequence for complete setup:
1. Start with Prompt 1 (Inventory)
2. Then Prompt 2 (Risk Assessment)
3. Follow with Prompt 3 (Tool Selection)
4. Use Prompt 6 (Environment Setup) or Prompt 7 (Access Control) based on needs
5. Implement Prompt 8 (Monitoring)
6. Prepare with Prompt 5 (Incident Response)
7. Maintain with Prompt 10 (Quarterly Audit)

ITERATION:
If outputs aren't specific enough:
- "Make this specific to [your platform/language]"
- "Provide actual command examples for [specific tool]"
- "Add more detail to steps 3-5"

SAVING OUTPUTS:
Keep all AI-generated procedures:
- Store in password-protected documentation
- Version control your policies (but not the keys!)
- Share with team via secure channels

VERIFICATION:
Always independently verify:
- Service-specific procedures (check official docs)
- Compliance requirements (consult legal/security team)
- Tool capabilities (test before relying on)
