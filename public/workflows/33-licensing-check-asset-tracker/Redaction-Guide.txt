REDACTION GUIDE - LICENSING CHECK & ASSET TRACKER
=================================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide helps you safely use AI tools for licensing check & asset tracker without
exposing sensitive personal, business, or client information. Follow these
steps before every AI interaction to maintain privacy and compliance.

==============================================================================
SECTION 1: TYPES OF DATA TO REDACT
==============================================================================

CATEGORY A: PERSONAL IDENTIFIERS (ALWAYS REDACT)
-------------------------------------------------
x NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Full names of real people
  - Email addresses
  - Phone numbers
  - Physical addresses
  - Social media handles/profiles
  - ID numbers (SSN, employee ID, etc.)
  - Photos or images of identifiable people

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "[PERSON_NAME]", "[TEAM_MEMBER]", "[CLIENT]"
  - "[EMAIL_ADDRESS]", "[PHONE]"
  - Role descriptions: "the project manager", "our client"
  - Generic identifiers: "Person A", "Company X"


CATEGORY B: BUSINESS INFORMATION (REDACT WHEN SENSITIVE)
--------------------------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Company names (if confidential context)
  - Revenue figures, pricing details
  - Strategic plans and roadmaps
  - Client lists and relationships
  - Internal processes and trade secrets
  - Unreleased product details
  - Competitive intelligence

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "[COMPANY]", "[CLIENT_ORG]"
  - Ranges instead of exact figures: "$100K-200K" vs "$147,523"
  - Generic descriptions: "a mid-size tech company"
  - Abstract scenarios: "a B2B SaaS product" vs. specific product name


CATEGORY C: TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL DETAILS
---------------------------------------------
x BE CAUTIOUS WITH:
  - API keys, passwords, credentials
  - Server names, IP addresses, URLs
  - Database schemas, system architecture
  - Security configurations
  - Proprietary algorithms or formulas
  - Internal tool configurations

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "[API_KEY]", "[SERVER]", "[URL]"
  - Generic architecture: "cloud-hosted database"
  - Process descriptions without implementation details
  - Tool categories instead of specific tool names (if sensitive)


==============================================================================
SECTION 2: STEP-BY-STEP REDACTION PROCESS
==============================================================================

STEP 1: SCAN BEFORE PASTING
----------------------------
Before putting any content into an AI tool:
[ ] Read through the entire text you plan to share
[ ] Highlight or mark any items from Categories A, B, C above
[ ] Count the number of items needing redaction

STEP 2: APPLY REDACTION
------------------------
For each identified item:
[ ] Replace with appropriate placeholder from the guide above
[ ] Ensure placeholders are consistent (same person = same placeholder)
[ ] Verify the redacted version still makes sense contextually

STEP 3: VERIFY COMPLETENESS
----------------------------
After redaction:
[ ] Re-read the entire redacted text
[ ] Search for common patterns: @, .com, $, specific names
[ ] Check for indirect identifiers (job titles + departments that identify someone)
[ ] Confirm no sensitive context can be inferred from remaining details

STEP 4: PROCESS WITH AI
------------------------
[ ] Submit redacted text to AI tool
[ ] Review AI output for any sensitive details that may have leaked through
[ ] Customize output with real details ONLY in your local document

STEP 5: POST-PROCESSING
------------------------
[ ] Review final output for any unredacted sensitive information
[ ] Replace any placeholders with real data only in secure storage
[ ] Do not share the un-redacted version through insecure channels


==============================================================================
SECTION 3: SCENARIO-SPECIFIC REDACTION
==============================================================================

SCENARIO 1: WORKING WITH CLIENT DATA
-------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Industry vertical (e.g., "healthcare company")
v General challenge description
v Anonymized metrics and outcomes
v Process steps and frameworks

Must redact:
x Client name and identifying details
x Specific contract terms or financials
x Proprietary client information
x Names of client team members


SCENARIO 2: SHARING OUTPUTS WITH TEAM
--------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Process documentation and templates
v Generic examples and frameworks
v AI-generated content (after review)
v Best practices and guidelines

Must redact:
x Information shared by team members in confidence
x Performance data tied to individuals
x Client-specific details in shared templates
x Any content marked as confidential


==============================================================================
SECTION 4: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
==============================================================================

Before sharing any output from this workflow:

[ ] All personal names replaced with placeholders or roles
[ ] All email addresses and phone numbers removed
[ ] Company names anonymized (unless public/non-sensitive context)
[ ] Financial figures generalized to ranges
[ ] Technical details (keys, URLs, IPs) removed
[ ] No combination of remaining details could identify someone
[ ] Screenshots scrubbed of visible sensitive information
[ ] File metadata cleaned (author name, organization)
[ ] Peer review completed (if sharing externally)


==============================================================================
SUPPORT & REMINDERS
==============================================================================

WHEN IN DOUBT: REDACT IT.
Over-redaction is always safer than under-redaction.

Remember:
- AI tools may retain or learn from your inputs
- Use privacy-respecting AI settings when available
- Review your AI tool's privacy policy periodically
- Different jurisdictions have different privacy requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

This guide is for educational purposes. Adapt to your organization's
specific security policies and regulatory requirements.
