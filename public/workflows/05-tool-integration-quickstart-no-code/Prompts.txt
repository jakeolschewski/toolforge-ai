- Any transformations needed

Format as a simple diagram I can recreate.


PROMPT 3 - ZAPIER RECIPE CREATOR
--------------------------------

Provide:
1. Trigger configuration
2. Any filter conditions
3. Action steps
4. Field mapping details
5. Testing checklist


PROMPT 4 - INTEGRATION TEST PLANNER
-----------------------------------

Critical data: [WHAT DATA MOVES]
Risk if it fails: [IMPACT]

Include:
- Test scenarios (happy path + edge cases)
- Sample test data
- Expected results
- Error conditions to test
- Go-live checklist


PROMPT 5 - ERROR HANDLING BUILDER
---------------------------------
Add error handling to my automation:

Current setup: [DESCRIBE YOUR INTEGRATION]
Common failures: [DESCRIBE ISSUES YOU'VE SEEN]

Provide:
1. Error detection steps
2. Notification setup (email/Slack alerts)
3. Retry logic recommendations
4. Fallback procedures
5. Error logging approach


PROMPT 6 - INTEGRATION OPTIMIZER
--------------------------------
Optimize my current integration for speed and cost:

Current setup: [DESCRIBE]
Monthly task count: [NUMBER]
Current cost: [AMOUNT]
Performance issues: [DESCRIBE]

Suggest:
- Ways to reduce task count (batching, filtering)
- Alternative approaches that cost less
- Performance improvements
- Monitoring setup


PROMPT 7 - INTEGRATION TROUBLESHOOTER
-------------------------------------
Help me troubleshoot this integration issue:

Setup: [TOOL_1] → [AUTOMATION_PLATFORM] → [TOOL_2]
Expected behavior: [WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN]
Actual behavior: [WHAT IS HAPPENING]
Error message (if any): [ERROR TEXT]

Walk me through debugging steps and common fixes.


PROMPT 8 - TEAM INTEGRATION SCALER
----------------------------------
Scale my personal integration for team use:

Current integration: [DESCRIBE]
Team size: [NUMBER]
Team technical level: [RANGE]

Provide:
- Multi-user configuration changes
- Permission and access setup
- Documentation template for team
- Training outline
- Monitoring for team usage


PROMPT 9 - ALTERNATIVE PLATFORM FINDER
--------------------------------------
Suggest alternative no-code tools for my integration:

Current platform: [ZAPIER/MAKE/OTHER]
What it does: [DESCRIBE]
Why I want alternatives: [COST/FEATURES/LIMITATIONS]

Compare 3 alternatives with:
- Feature comparison
- Pricing
- Ease of migration
- Pros and cons


PROMPT 10 - INTEGRATION DOCUMENTATION CREATOR
---------------------------------------------
Create documentation for my integration:

Integration name: [NAME]
Purpose: [WHAT IT DOES]
Tools connected: [LIST]
Trigger: [WHAT STARTS IT]
Actions: [WHAT HAPPENS]

Generate:
1. Overview document
2. Setup instructions for new team members
3. Troubleshooting guide
4. Maintenance checklist

USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

PRIVACY PROTECTION:
When using these prompts, NEVER include:
- Actual confidential business information
- Real names, email addresses, or contact details
- Proprietary data, trade secrets, or internal metrics
- Client or customer identifying information
- Financial details (exact revenues, salaries, etc.)

Use placeholders:
- "[CLIENT_NAME]", "[COMPANY]" instead of real names
- "[AMOUNT]", "[METRIC]" for sensitive numbers
- Generic descriptions of situations rather than specifics

AI TOOL COMPATIBILITY:
These prompts work with all major AI assistants:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- Use with privacy-respecting settings (opt-out of training)

PROMPT CHAINING:
For best results, use prompts in sequence:
1. Start with Prompt 1 for initial setup
2. Use Prompts 2-5 for core workflow steps
3. Apply Prompts 6-8 for advanced applications
4. Use Prompts 9-10 for optimization and scaling

ITERATION:
If outputs aren't specific enough:
- "Make this specific to [your industry/context]"
- "Provide actual examples for [specific scenario]"
- "Add more detail to [specific section]"

SAVING OUTPUTS:
Keep all AI-generated outputs:
- Store in organized folders by date and topic
- Version control your working documents
- Share with team via secure channels only

VERIFICATION:
Always independently verify:
- Facts, figures, and claims in AI outputs
- Recommendations against your specific context
- Compliance with your organization's policies
