# Brainstorm Session Simulator - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview and Objectives

The Brainstorm Session Simulator uses AI to facilitate structured brainstorming sessions that generate, refine, and evaluate ideas systematically. Whether working solo or with a team, this workflow applies proven frameworks like SCAMPER and Six Thinking Hats to produce 20-50 evaluated ideas in a single session.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Set clear brainstorming topics with defined constraints
- Generate a high volume of diverse ideas using proven frameworks
- Refine and group ideas into actionable categories
- Evaluate feasibility and potential impact of top ideas
- Select and document the most promising ideas for action

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 20-50 ideas generated per session
- Ideas grouped into logical categories with evaluation scores
- Top 3-5 ideas selected with documented rationale
- Action plan for developing the best ideas further
- Reusable brainstorming framework for future sessions

**W.E.D.G.E Framework Integration:**
- **Workflow**: Systematizes creative ideation with structured frameworks
- **Education**: Teaches brainstorming techniques like SCAMPER and Six Thinking Hats
- **Data**: Keeps strategic ideas confidential with proper redaction
- **Guidance**: Provides clear evaluation criteria for idea selection
- **Empowerment**: Enables solo or team brainstorming with professional results

## Prerequisites

- A defined topic or challenge to brainstorm about
- Access to an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Note-taking tool for capturing ideas
- 30-60 minutes for a full brainstorming session
- Open mind and willingness to explore unconventional ideas

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Define Topic and Constraints (5-10 minutes)

   - [ ] Write a clear, specific brainstorming question or challenge
   - [ ] Define any constraints (budget, timeline, technology, etc.)
   - [ ] Identify the target audience or stakeholders for the ideas
   - [ ] Set a quantity goal (e.g., 'generate at least 20 ideas')
   - [ ] Choose a brainstorming framework (SCAMPER, Six Thinking Hats, etc.)

**Output:** Completed step 1 deliverables

---

### Step 2: Generate Ideas — Quantity First (10-15 minutes)

   - [ ] Use AI to generate initial idea batch using your chosen framework
   - [ ] Build on each idea with 'yes, and...' thinking
   - [ ] Explore opposites and extremes to find unconventional ideas
   - [ ] Combine elements from different ideas to create hybrids
   - [ ] Don't filter or judge ideas during this phase — capture everything

**Output:** Completed step 2 deliverables

---

### Step 3: Refine and Group (5-10 minutes)

   - [ ] Review all ideas and remove exact duplicates
   - [ ] Group similar ideas into 3-5 logical categories
   - [ ] Name each category clearly
   - [ ] Identify patterns and themes across categories
   - [ ] Note any gaps — categories with few ideas may need more exploration

**Output:** Completed step 3 deliverables

---

### Step 4: Evaluate Feasibility (5-10 minutes)

   - [ ] Score each idea on feasibility (1-5 scale)
   - [ ] Score each idea on potential impact (1-5 scale)
   - [ ] Score each idea on originality/differentiation (1-5 scale)
   - [ ] Calculate total score and rank ideas
   - [ ] Highlight any high-impact ideas that need further research

**Output:** Completed step 4 deliverables

---

### Step 5: Select and Plan (5-10 minutes)

   - [ ] Select top 3-5 ideas based on scores and discussion
   - [ ] Document rationale for selection
   - [ ] Create next steps for developing each selected idea
   - [ ] Assign ownership if working with a team
   - [ ] Schedule follow-up session to review progress

**Output:** Completed step 5 deliverables

## Best Practices

1. **Separate idea generation from evaluation — judging kills creativity**
2. **Set a quantity goal to push past obvious ideas to creative ones**
3. **Use multiple frameworks (SCAMPER, reverse brainstorming) for diverse results**
4. **Include wild/impossible ideas — they often spark practical innovations**
5. **Take breaks between generation and evaluation phases**
6. **For team sessions, have everyone generate individually before sharing**
7. **Document ALL ideas — today's 'bad' idea may be tomorrow's breakthrough**
8. **Rotate the AI framework or prompt style to avoid repetitive outputs**
9. **Time-box each phase to maintain energy and focus**
10. **Follow up on selected ideas within 48 hours to maintain momentum**

## Common Pitfalls

1. **"Judging during generation"**: Enforce a 'no criticism' rule during idea generation — evaluate later
   - *Solution:* Enforce a 'no criticism' rule during idea generation — evaluate later
2. **"Anchoring on the first idea"**: Force yourself to generate 10+ ideas before evaluating any of them
   - *Solution:* Force yourself to generate 10+ ideas before evaluating any of them
3. **"Groupthink in teams"**: Have people brainstorm individually first, then share and combine
   - *Solution:* Have people brainstorm individually first, then share and combine
4. **"Too broad a topic"**: Narrow your brainstorming question — 'improve everything' produces nothing useful
   - *Solution:* Narrow your brainstorming question — 'improve everything' produces nothing useful
5. **"Skipping evaluation"**: Without scoring and ranking, you'll default to the loudest voice's favorite
   - *Solution:* Without scoring and ranking, you'll default to the loudest voice's favorite
6. **"Not following up"**: Ideas without action plans die — assign next steps before ending the session
   - *Solution:* Ideas without action plans die — assign next steps before ending the session
7. **"Same framework every time"**: Rotate frameworks to get different types of ideas
   - *Solution:* Rotate frameworks to get different types of ideas
8. **"Perfectionism in selection"**: Pick good-enough ideas and iterate — you can always brainstorm again
   - *Solution:* Pick good-enough ideas and iterate — you can always brainstorm again

## Time Estimates

- **Initial Setup:** 45-60 minutes (first full session)
- **Per Use:** 30-45 minutes per session
- **Maintenance:** 15 minutes for follow-up review

## Success Criteria
