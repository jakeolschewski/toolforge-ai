Target audience: [WHO IS THIS FOR]

Generate 20 ideas using the SCAMPER framework:
- Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other use, Eliminate, Reverse

Label each idea with which SCAMPER technique inspired it.


PROMPT 2 - IDEA GENERATOR
-------------------------
Generate [NUMBER] ideas for [TOPIC] with these constraints:

Constraints:
- Budget: [AMOUNT]

- Note any gaps (categories with few ideas)
- Suggest 2-3 additional ideas per category


PROMPT 4 - FEASIBILITY EVALUATOR
--------------------------------
Evaluate the feasibility of these ideas:

[LIST YOUR TOP IDEAS]

For each idea, score (1-5) on:
- Technical feasibility: Can it be done?
- Financial feasibility: Can we afford it?
- Time feasibility: Can we do it in time?
- Market feasibility: Will people want it?
- Resource feasibility: Do we have the team?

Rank by total score and recommend top 3.


PROMPT 5 - IDEA REFINER
-----------------------
Refine these top 5 ideas into actionable concepts:

[LIST YOUR TOP 5 IDEAS]

For each idea, develop:
- One-paragraph concept description
- Key value proposition
- Implementation steps (high-level)
- Estimated resources needed
- Potential risks and how to address them
- First milestone within 2 weeks


PROMPT 6 - TEAM BRAINSTORM FACILITATOR
--------------------------------------
Design a team brainstorming session:

Topic: [YOUR TOPIC]

Time available: [MINUTES]
Remote or in-person: [SPECIFY]

Provide:
- Icebreaker activity (2-3 minutes)
- Brainstorming rules to establish
- Round-by-round structure
- Individual → group transition approach
- Voting/selection method


PROMPT 7 - CREATIVE TWIST GENERATOR
-----------------------------------
Add creative twists to these existing ideas:

[LIST YOUR IDEAS]

For each idea, apply these creativity techniques:
- Reverse it: What if we did the opposite?
- Scale it: What if it was 10x bigger? 10x smaller?
- Combine it: What if we merged it with [ANOTHER IDEA]?
- Borrow it: How would [DIFFERENT INDUSTRY] approach this?

Generate 2 variations per technique.


PROMPT 8 - CREATIVE BLOCK BUSTER
--------------------------------
I'm stuck brainstorming about [TOPIC]. Help me break through the block.

What I've already considered: [LIST EXISTING IDEAS]
Where I'm stuck: [DESCRIBE THE BLOCK]

Try these approaches:
1. Six Thinking Hats (look from 6 different perspectives)
2. Random word association (use these random words as triggers)
3. Analogy thinking (how do other fields solve this?)
4. Constraint removal (what if [biggest constraint] didn't exist?)


PROMPT 9 - IDEA EXPORT FORMATTER
--------------------------------
Format these brainstorming results for sharing:

[PASTE YOUR IDEAS AND EVALUATIONS]

Create:
1. Executive summary (top 3 ideas, one paragraph each)
2. Full idea list organized by category
3. Evaluation matrix table
4. Recommended next steps
5. Session metrics (total ideas, categories, top scores)


PROMPT 10 - FOLLOW-UP BRAINSTORM
--------------------------------
We brainstormed about [TOPIC] last time and selected these ideas:

[LIST SELECTED IDEAS AND ANY PROGRESS]

Now help us:
1. Generate 10 new ideas building on what we learned
2. Identify aspects we didn't explore last time
3. Challenge assumptions from the first session
4. Combine top ideas in new ways
5. Plan the next action steps
