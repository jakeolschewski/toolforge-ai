REDACTION GUIDE - CUSTOM DASHBOARD TEMPLATE CREATOR
====================================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide helps you safely create, share, and distribute dashboard templates
without exposing actual business data, personal information, or proprietary
metrics. It covers redaction practices for sample data, exported templates,
and shared documentation.

=============================================================================
SECTION 1: TYPES OF DATA TO REDACT
=============================================================================

CATEGORY A: FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS DATA (NEVER SHARE)
------------------------------------------------------
x ABSOLUTELY NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Real revenue, profit, or cost figures
  - Actual budget allocations or spending amounts
  - Customer acquisition costs or lifetime values
  - Pricing information or discount structures
  - Salary or compensation data
  - Investment or funding details
  - Proprietary margin calculations
  - Real sales pipeline values

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Round to ranges: "$50K-75K" instead of "$63,247"
  - Use percentages: "Revenue up 12%" instead of actual figures
  - Generic labels: "[MONTHLY_REVENUE]", "[Q1_TARGET]"
  - Clearly fictional values: "$100,000" with "[SAMPLE]" label
  - Normalized data: Index to 100 baseline instead of real values

CATEGORY B: PERSONAL AND EMPLOYEE DATA
---------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Employee names and performance scores
  - Individual productivity metrics
  - Team member assignments or workloads
  - Personal email addresses or contact info
  - Attendance or time tracking records
  - Performance review data
  - Compensation or bonus information

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Roles: "Team Lead", "Analyst 1", "Developer 2"
  - Generic teams: "Team Alpha", "Team Beta"
  - Fictional names: "Alex Smith", "Jordan Lee" (clearly fake)
  - Aggregate data: "Team average: 87%" instead of individual scores
  - Role-based labels: "[MANAGER_NAME]", "[IC_1]"

CATEGORY C: CLIENT AND CUSTOMER DATA
-------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Client company names
  - Customer account IDs or identifiers
  - Deal sizes or contract values
  - Customer contact information
  - Project names tied to real clients
  - Customer usage or behavior data
  - Churn or retention details for specific accounts

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Fictional companies: "Acme Corp", "Globex Industries", "Initech"
  - Industry labels: "Client A (Healthcare)", "Client B (Finance)"
  - Generic projects: "Project Alpha", "Project Lighthouse"
  - Aggregated metrics: "Average client value" vs. specific account
  - Account codes: "ACCT-001", "ACCT-002"

CATEGORY D: PROPRIETARY METRICS AND FORMULAS
---------------------------------------------
x BE CAUTIOUS WITH:
  - Custom KPI calculation formulas
  - Proprietary scoring algorithms
  - Competitive intelligence metrics
  - Internal benchmark thresholds
  - Business logic encoded in formulas
  - Trade-secret processes reflected in dashboard structure

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Generic descriptions: "Calculated from weighted average of 3 inputs"
  - Standard formulas: Use publicly known calculation methods
  - Placeholder formulas: "=SUM([RANGE])" instead of specific cell references
  - Simplified versions: Show concept without proprietary detail
  - Notes: "Custom formula - replace with your organization's calculation"

CATEGORY E: INFRASTRUCTURE AND SYSTEM DETAILS
----------------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Internal system URLs or API endpoints
  - Database connection strings or server names
  - Data warehouse table names or schema details
  - Authentication tokens embedded in data connections
  - Internal tool configurations or settings
  - Network architecture reflected in data flow

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Generic: "Data Source: CRM System" instead of specific URL
  - Placeholders: "[DATABASE_ENDPOINT]", "[API_URL]"
  - Category labels: "Sales database", "Marketing analytics platform"
  - Architecture notes: "Cloud-hosted data warehouse" vs. specific service

=============================================================================
SECTION 2: STEP-BY-STEP REDACTION PROCESS
=============================================================================

STEP 1: PRE-REDACTION SCAN
---------------------------
Before sharing any dashboard template:

[ ] Search for real company names (yours and clients')
[ ] Search for employee or team member names
[ ] Search for dollar amounts that match real figures
[ ] Search for email addresses and phone numbers
[ ] Search for dates tied to real events or milestones
[ ] Search for internal project codenames
[ ] Search for URLs, API keys, or connection strings
[ ] Search for account numbers or customer IDs
[ ] Review all formulas for hardcoded sensitive values
[ ] Check conditional formatting thresholds against real targets

STEP 2: FINANCIAL DATA MASKING
-------------------------------
For each financial metric in the dashboard:

Real Revenue Data:
x BEFORE: Q1 Revenue: $2,347,891 | Q2 Revenue: $2,891,234
v AFTER:  Q1 Revenue: [SAMPLE] $2,500,000 | Q2 Revenue: [SAMPLE] $2,800,000
    OR:  Q1 Revenue: [YOUR_Q1_REVENUE] | Q2 Revenue: [YOUR_Q2_REVENUE]

Budget Allocations:
x BEFORE: Marketing: $425,000 | Engineering: $1,200,000 | Sales: $680,000
v AFTER:  Marketing: [SAMPLE] $400,000 | Engineering: [SAMPLE] $1,000,000
    OR:  [DEPT_1]: [BUDGET_1] | [DEPT_2]: [BUDGET_2]

Cost Metrics:
x BEFORE: CAC: $127.43 | LTV: $4,891 | CAC:LTV Ratio: 1:38.4
v AFTER:  CAC: [SAMPLE] $125 | LTV: [SAMPLE] $5,000 | Ratio: [SAMPLE] 1:40
    OR:  CAC: [YOUR_CAC] | LTV: [YOUR_LTV] | Ratio: [CALCULATED]

STEP 3: PERSONNEL DATA ANONYMIZATION
-------------------------------------
Replace all personal identifiers:

Team Performance Table:
x BEFORE:
| Name           | Role      | Tasks Done | Score |
| Sarah Chen     | Lead      | 47         | 94%   |
| Mike Rodriguez | Dev       | 38         | 87%   |
| Emily Park     | Designer  | 29         | 91%   |

v AFTER:
| Name           | Role      | Tasks Done | Score |
| [Team Lead]    | Lead      | [SAMPLE] 45| 92%   |
| [Developer 1]  | Dev       | [SAMPLE] 38| 87%   |
| [Designer 1]   | Designer  | [SAMPLE] 30| 90%   |

OR (with fictional names):
| Name           | Role      | Tasks Done | Score |
| Alex Smith     | Lead      | [SAMPLE] 45| 92%   |
| Jordan Lee     | Dev       | [SAMPLE] 38| 87%   |
| Taylor Kim     | Designer  | [SAMPLE] 30| 90%   |

STEP 4: CLIENT AND PROJECT ANONYMIZATION
-----------------------------------------
Replace real client and project references:

Client Pipeline:
x BEFORE:
| Client              | Deal Size   | Stage      | Close Date |
| Walmart Corp        | $2.4M       | Negotiation| 2026-03-15 |
| JP Morgan Chase     | $890K       | Proposal   | 2026-04-01 |

v AFTER:
| Client              | Deal Size   | Stage      | Close Date |
| [SAMPLE] Acme Corp  | $2.5M       | Negotiation| [DATE]     |
| [SAMPLE] Globex Inc | $900K       | Proposal   | [DATE]     |

Project Tracker:
x BEFORE: "Project Phoenix - Nike Rebrand Q2 2026"
v AFTER:  "[SAMPLE] Project Alpha - Brand Refresh Initiative"

STEP 5: FORMULA AND LOGIC REDACTION
------------------------------------
When sharing templates with formulas:

Proprietary Calculations:
x BEFORE:
=((B2*0.73+C2*0.15+D2*0.12)*VLOOKUP(A2,SecretWeights!A:B,2,0))/E2
v AFTER:
=((B2*[WEIGHT_1]+C2*[WEIGHT_2]+D2*[WEIGHT_3])*[ADJUSTMENT_FACTOR])/E2
    OR:
=[YOUR_CUSTOM_FORMULA_HERE]
    WITH NOTE: "Replace with your organization's scoring calculation"

Data Source References:
x BEFORE: =IMPORTDATA("https://api.internal.acmecorp.com/metrics/revenue")
v AFTER:  =IMPORTDATA("[YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_URL]")
    OR:   =[Manual data entry - connect to your data source]

Conditional Formatting:
x BEFORE: Green if > $127,500 (real target); Red if < $85,000
v AFTER:  Green if > [YOUR_TARGET]; Yellow if > [YOUR_WARNING]; Red if < [YOUR_MINIMUM]
    WITH NOTE: "Adjust thresholds to match your organization's targets"

STEP 6: METADATA AND HIDDEN DATA CLEANUP
-----------------------------------------
Remove non-visible sensitive information:

Google Sheets:
[ ] File > Check revision history for sensitive data in earlier versions
[ ] Check for hidden sheets with raw data
[ ] Review named ranges for sensitive references
[ ] Clear data validation lists that reference real data
[ ] Remove comments containing sensitive information
[ ] Check "File > Details" for authorship information
[ ] Remove any Apps Script containing credentials or URLs

Notion:
[ ] Check page history for real data in earlier edits
[ ] Review linked databases for exposed fields
[ ] Remove comments and discussion threads with sensitive info
[ ] Check relation properties that link to private databases
[ ] Verify shared page doesn't inherit parent page permissions

Airtable:
[ ] Check revision history on records
[ ] Review linked records pointing to private bases
[ ] Remove automations containing real endpoints or emails
[ ] Clear form submissions containing real data
[ ] Remove comments on records with sensitive information

PDF/Wireframe:
[ ] Strip document properties (author, company, creation date)
[ ] Remove embedded fonts that reveal organizational info
[ ] Check for hidden layers or annotations
[ ] Flatten form fields to prevent extraction

STEP 7: SCREENSHOT AND IMAGE REDACTION
---------------------------------------
When sharing dashboard screenshots:

x BEFORE: Full screenshot showing real data, URLs, and user identity
v AFTER:  Screenshot with:
  - All numerical values replaced or blurred
  - Browser URL bar cropped out
  - User avatar and profile info removed or blurred
  - Any notification badges or sidebar content cropped
  - Watermark added: "[SAMPLE DASHBOARD - Not Real Data]"

Tools for screenshot redaction:
- macOS Preview: Use rectangle annotation tool with solid fill
- Pixelmator / Photoshop: Blur or solid-color overlay
- Notion: Crop before pasting
- Markup tools: Use platform-native markup/redaction

=============================================================================
SECTION 3: SCENARIO-SPECIFIC REDACTION
=============================================================================

SCENARIO 1: SHARING TEMPLATE WITH TEAM
---------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Layout structure and section arrangement
v Visualization type recommendations
v Generic metric names and categories
v Formula structures with placeholder references
v Conditional formatting logic (with generic thresholds)

Must redact:
x Real financial data or targets
x Individual performance data
x Client or customer names
x Proprietary calculation formulas
x Internal system URLs or credentials

SCENARIO 2: PUBLISHING TEMPLATE FOR PUBLIC USE
-----------------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Complete template structure
v Sample data with fictional entities
v Generic formulas and formatting
v Platform-specific setup instructions
v Design principles and best practices

Must redact:
x ALL real data (replace with clearly labeled samples)
x Organization-specific terminology or jargon
x Internal process details
x Proprietary metric definitions
x Any data that could identify the source organization
x Screenshots of real dashboards (use mockups instead)

SCENARIO 3: CLIENT-FACING DASHBOARD DELIVERY
---------------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Client's own data (with their permission)
v Agreed-upon metrics and visualizations
v Standard industry benchmarks

Must redact:
x Other clients' data or benchmarks
x Internal cost or margin information
x Proprietary methodology details
x Backend system or infrastructure details
x Team member personal information

SCENARIO 4: PORTFOLIO OR CASE STUDY USE
----------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Dashboard design and layout (visual)
v Anonymized metrics and sample data
v Process and methodology description
v General outcomes (percentages, not absolutes)

Must redact:
x Client name (unless written permission obtained)
x Exact financial figures
x Proprietary formulas or algorithms
x Any data that could identify the client through inference
x Internal stakeholder names or roles

=============================================================================
SECTION 4: AUTOMATED REDACTION TOOLS
=============================================================================

COMMAND-LINE TOOLS
------------------
1. Spreadsheet Data Masking (Python):
   # Replace real names with fictional ones
   import pandas as pd
   import faker

   fake = faker.Faker()
   df = pd.read_csv('dashboard_data.csv')
   df['client_name'] = [fake.company() for _ in range(len(df))]
   df['employee_name'] = [fake.name() for _ in range(len(df))]
   df.to_csv('dashboard_data_redacted.csv', index=False)

2. Financial Data Rounding (Excel/Sheets):
   # Round to nearest $1,000 and add [SAMPLE] prefix
   =TEXT(ROUND(A2, -3), "$#,##0")
   # Or replace with placeholder
   ="[SAMPLE] "&TEXT(ROUND(A2*RANDBETWEEN(90,110)/100, -3), "$#,##0")

3. Metadata Stripping (command line):
   # PDF metadata removal
   exiftool -all= dashboard_export.pdf

   # Office document metadata
   exiftool -all= dashboard_template.xlsx

MANUAL VERIFICATION
-------------------
Automated tools miss context-specific sensitivity:
- Metric combinations that reveal strategy (growth rates + market share)
- Temporal patterns that identify real events
- Relative proportions that expose business model
- Section titles that reference internal initiatives
- Color coding that matches known brand guidelines

Always manually review after automated redaction.

=============================================================================
SECTION 5: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

Before sharing any dashboard template:

[ ] All financial figures replaced with samples or placeholders
[ ] All personal names replaced with roles or fictional names
[ ] All client/customer names anonymized
[ ] All proprietary formulas genericized or replaced
[ ] All internal URLs and system references removed
[ ] All conditional formatting thresholds genericized
[ ] File metadata stripped (author, company, dates)
[ ] Hidden sheets/tabs checked and cleared
[ ] Revision history reviewed for sensitive data
[ ] Comments and notes cleared of sensitive information
[ ] Screenshots blurred/cropped to remove real data
[ ] Sample data clearly labeled as "[SAMPLE]" throughout
[ ] Data validation lists contain only generic options
[ ] Linked databases or external references disconnected
[ ] Export tested in target format (no data leakage in conversion)

PEER REVIEW:
[ ] Second person reviewed template for missed redactions
[ ] Reviewer was unfamiliar with the real data (fresh perspective)

=============================================================================
SECTION 6: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
=============================================================================

INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------
Financial Services: Redact all trade data, portfolio compositions, and
  compliance metrics. Even sample data should not resemble real positions.
Healthcare: Never include any PHI, even as sample data. Use completely
  fictional patient or facility identifiers.
Government: Redact classification markings, internal program names,
  and budget line items even in template form.
Education: Remove student identifiers, grades, and FERPA-protected data.

TEMPLATE LIBRARIES AND MARKETPLACES
------------------------------------
If publishing templates to a marketplace or library:
- Assume global audience with varying data privacy regulations
- Use internationally neutral sample data (no country-specific formats)
- Avoid industry jargon that could identify the source
- Include explicit licensing terms for template reuse
- State that sample data is fictional in multiple locations

DATA RESIDENCY CONSIDERATIONS
------------------------------
When exporting to cloud platforms:
- Notion: Data stored in US (AWS)
- Google Sheets: Regional settings based on Google Workspace config
- Airtable: Data stored in US
- If GDPR or other residency requirements apply, document where
  the dashboard data will reside after export

=============================================================================
SUPPORT & QUESTIONS
=============================================================================

When in doubt: USE FAKE DATA.
Over-redaction is safer than under-redaction for templates.

For sensitive situations, consult:
- Legal team before sharing dashboards with financial data
- Compliance team before sharing dashboards with regulated metrics
- Security team before connecting dashboards to live data sources
- HR team before sharing dashboards with employee performance data

This guide is for educational purposes. Adapt to your organization's
specific data classification policies and regulatory requirements.
