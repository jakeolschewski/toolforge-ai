USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

PRIVACY PROTECTION:
When using these prompts, NEVER include:
- Real company financial data or revenue figures
- Actual employee names or performance data
- Customer or client names and contact information
- Proprietary KPI formulas or business logic
- Internal URLs, database names, or system credentials
- Confidential project details or unreleased product information

Use placeholders:
- "Company A", "Team B" instead of real organization names
- "[REVENUE_FIGURE]" instead of actual financial data
- Generic role descriptions instead of individual names
- Approximate ranges instead of exact figures

AI TOOL COMPATIBILITY:
These prompts work with all major AI assistants:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- Use with privacy-respecting settings (opt-out of training)

PROMPT CHAINING:
Recommended sequence for complete dashboard creation:
1. Start with Prompt 1 (Template Generator) for the core structure
2. Then Prompt 2 (Layout Ideas) for visual design
3. Follow with Prompt 5 (Interactive Elements) for functionality
4. Use Prompt 3 (Sample Data) to populate and test
5. Customize with Prompt 4 (Role-Specific) for each audience
6. Optimize with Prompt 6 (Mobile) for device compatibility
7. Audit with Prompt 8 (Usability) for quality assurance
8. Export with Prompt 7 (Export Options) for distribution
9. Enhance with Prompt 9 (AI Updates) for automation
10. Collaborate with Prompt 10 (Team Features) for team adoption

ITERATION:
If outputs aren't specific enough:
- "Make this specific to [your platform/industry]"
- "Provide actual formulas for [Google Sheets/Notion/Airtable]"
- "Add more detail to the [section name]"
- "Simplify for a non-technical audience"

SAVING OUTPUTS:
Keep all AI-generated dashboard designs:
- Store templates in your organization's template library
- Version control your dashboard specifications
- Share with team via approved collaboration channels

VERIFICATION:
Always independently verify:
- Platform-specific feature availability (check official docs)
- Formula accuracy (test with known values before deploying)
- Data privacy compliance (consult legal/compliance for sensitive dashboards)
- Accessibility standards (test with screen readers and colorblind simulators)
