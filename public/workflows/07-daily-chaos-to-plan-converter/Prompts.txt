DAILY CHAOS-TO-PLAN CONVERTER - PROMPT VARIATIONS
=================================================

PROMPT 1 - CHAOS LIST CONVERTER
-------------------------------
Convert my chaos list into a structured daily plan:

[PASTE YOUR BRAIN DUMP LIST HERE]

Consider:
- My work hours: [START_TIME] to [END_TIME]
- My peak energy time: [MORNING/AFTERNOON/EVENING]
- Hard deadlines today: [LIST ANY]
- Meetings already scheduled: [LIST ANY]

Output: Time-blocked plan with top 3 priorities highlighted.


PROMPT 2 - TASK PRIORITIZER
---------------------------
Prioritize these tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important):

[LIST YOUR TASKS]

For each task, categorize as:
- Do First (urgent + important)
- Schedule (important, not urgent)
- Delegate (urgent, not important)
- Eliminate (neither)

Then create a recommended order of execution.


PROMPT 3 - IDEA CATEGORIZER
---------------------------
Categorize these mixed items into actionable buckets:

[PASTE YOUR BRAIN DUMP - tasks, ideas, reminders, etc.]

Sort into:
- Tasks (actionable items with clear next steps)

- Waiting On (blocked, need input from others)
- Reference (information to file, not act on)
- Habits (recurring items to build into routine)


PROMPT 4 - TIME BLOCK PLANNER

Add time estimates and create a time-blocked schedule:

Tasks for today:
[LIST YOUR PRIORITIZED TASKS]

Available hours: [START] to [END]

Include 15-minute buffers between blocks and at least one 30-minute break.


PROMPT 5 - DAY SIMULATOR
------------------------
Simulate a productive day plan from this overwhelming list:

[PASTE YOUR MASSIVE TASK LIST]

Constraints:
- Maximum [NUMBER] hours of focused work
- Must include [SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS]

Show me: Realistic plan, what gets deferred, and why.


PROMPT 6 - CONSTRAINT OPTIMIZER
-------------------------------
Optimize my plan for these time constraints:

Must complete today: [LIST NON-NEGOTIABLES]
Would like to complete: [LIST NICE-TO-HAVES]
Available time: [HOURS]
Interruption likelihood: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]

Create a plan that guarantees the must-dos and maximizes nice-to-haves.

Current plan:
[PASTE YOUR TIME-BLOCKED PLAN]

- Lunch break
- Brief movement or stretch breaks
- End-of-day wind-down


PROMPT 8 - TEAM CHAOS CONVERTER
-------------------------------
Convert our team's collective chaos into a coordinated plan:

Team members and their dumps:
[PERSON_1]: [THEIR TASKS]
[PERSON_2]: [THEIR TASKS]

Shared deadlines: [LIST]
Dependencies: [WHO NEEDS WHAT FROM WHOM]

Create individual plans that account for handoffs and shared goals.

------------------------
Review and adjust yesterday's plan based on what actually happened:
