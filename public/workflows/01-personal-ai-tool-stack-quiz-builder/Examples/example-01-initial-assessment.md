## AI-Generated Quiz Questions

Based on the requirements above, here are the personalized assessment questions:

### Workflow Questions (1-5)

1. **What percentage of your content creation time is spent on research vs. writing vs. editing?**
   - Research: 30% | Writing: 40% | Editing: 30%

2. **How often do you need to reference previous conversations or projects when creating new content?**
   - Daily. I frequently refer back to client briefs, previous articles in a series, and established brand guidelines.

3. **Which content format takes the most time to create relative to its value?**
   - Social media graphics. High effort (30-45 min per set), moderate value (engagement varies).

4. **Do you batch similar tasks or work on projects from start to finish individually?**
   - Mix of both. Batch social media content on Mondays, but blog posts are start-to-finish.

5. **How many different client brands/voices do you manage simultaneously?**
   - 4-5 active clients with distinct brand voices and guidelines.

### Privacy Questions (6-8)

6. **Do you work with any sensitive topics or regulated industries? (Rate sensitivity 1-10)**
   - 4/10. Some healthcare clients (wellness/nutrition) but no PHI. General B2B content.

7. **How comfortable are you with AI tools training on your inputs to improve their models?**
   - Uncomfortable for client work. Acceptable for personal projects or generic content.

8. **Do your clients have specific data processing or privacy requirements?**
   - Two clients require GDPR compliance. One prefers US-only data processing.

### Technical Questions (9-12)

9. **Rate your comfort with API integrations and automation tools like Zapier (1-10)**
   - 6/10. Used Zapier basic automations. Can follow tutorials but don't code.

10. **What's your tolerance for learning new tools? (Time available per month for training)**
    - 3-5 hours/month. Prefer intuitive interfaces with minimal learning curve.

11. **Do you need mobile/offline access to your AI tools?**
    - Mobile: Yes (for drafting on-the-go). Offline: Nice-to-have but not essential.

12. **Which existing tools are non-negotiable in your workflow?**
    - Google Docs (collaboration with clients), WordPress (publishing platform), Gmail.

### Budget Questions (13-15)

13. **What time savings would justify a $50/month tool investment?**
    - 5-7 hours/month saved (my hourly rate is ~$75, so $375-525 monthly value).

14. **Would you pay more for a tool that consolidates 3 separate subscriptions?**
    - Yes, if it saves at least 20% on total cost and maintains feature parity.

15. **How important is a free trial period before committing? (1-10)**
    - 10/10. Essential. Minimum 7-day trial, prefer 14-30 days.

### Integration Questions (16-18)

16. **Which workflow step creates the most friction when switching between tools?**
    - Moving from AI writing assistant → Google Docs → WordPress → social media. 4+ tool switches per article.

17. **Do you prefer all-in-one platforms or best-of-breed specialized tools?**
    - Best-of-breed, as long as integration is seamless. All-in-one tools often lack depth.

18. **What data needs to flow automatically between your tools?**
    - Blog content → social snippets, performance metrics → content calendar, client briefs → writing context.

### Outcome Questions (19-20)

19. **What would "perfect AI tool stack" enable you to do that you can't do today?**
    - Publish 5-6 posts/week instead of 3-4, maintain consistent social presence, take on 2-3 more clients.

20. **Which single pain point, if solved, would have the biggest impact on your productivity?**
    - Context retention across sessions. Constantly re-explaining project details wastes 30-45 min/day.
