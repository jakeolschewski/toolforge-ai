## Risk Mitigation & Contingency Plans

### Potential Blockers

**1. Tool Learning Curve Longer Than Expected**
- *Mitigation:* Allocate 50% buffer time for training
- *Contingency:* Delay next phase by 2 weeks if needed; don't stack complexity

**2. Automation Failures Disrupt Workflow**
- *Mitigation:* Maintain manual backup processes for all automations
- *Contingency:* Temporarily disable automation and revert to manual until fixed

**3. Budget Constraints (Client Loss, Unexpected Expenses)**
- *Mitigation:* Phase 3 tools are optional; can pause at Phase 2
- *Contingency:* Prioritize tools with highest ROI, pause/cancel experimental tools

**4. Tool Deprecation or Major Price Changes**
- *Mitigation:* Monitor tool news/updates monthly; always have alternative identified
- *Contingency:* Fallback to alternative tool from recommendations list

**5. Privacy/Security Incident**
- *Mitigation:* Quarterly privacy policy reviews, never input client confidential data
- *Contingency:* Immediate notification to affected clients, switch to enterprise tier or alternative tool
