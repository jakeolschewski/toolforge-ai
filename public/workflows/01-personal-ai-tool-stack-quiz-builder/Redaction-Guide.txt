REDACTION GUIDE - PERSONAL AI TOOL STACK QUIZ & BUILDER
========================================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide helps you remove sensitive, proprietary, or personally identifiable
information (PII) when sharing your tool stack assessment with AI systems,
collaborators, or for documentation purposes.

=============================================================================
SECTION 1: TYPES OF DATA TO REDACT
=============================================================================

CATEGORY A: PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII)
------------------------------------------------------
✗ NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Your full name, email address, phone number
  - Home or business address
  - Government ID numbers (SSN, passport, etc.)
  - Financial account numbers
  - Personal photos or identifying images

✓ SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Use role/title instead: "Freelance Content Creator", "Marketing Manager"
  - Use generic email: "user@example.com"
  - Use region only: "Based in EU", "US West Coast"


CATEGORY B: BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
✗ NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Client names, company names (real ones)
  - Proprietary product names or internal codenames
  - Specific revenue figures, pricing strategies
  - Competitive intelligence or market strategies
  - Unreleased product/feature information
  - Internal-only metrics or KPIs

✓ SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "Client A (healthcare)", "Client B (e-commerce)"
  - "Enterprise SaaS client", "SMB retail customer"
  - Revenue ranges: "$50K-100K ARR" instead of exact figures
  - Generic descriptions: "productivity tool" vs. proprietary name
  - Percentage growth instead of absolute numbers


CATEGORY C: WORKFLOW-SPECIFIC DETAILS
--------------------------------------
✗ POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Exact publication schedules (reveals vulnerability windows)
  - Specific domain names, social media handles
  - Proprietary processes or methodologies
  - Customer data handling procedures
  - Security implementation details

✓ SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "Publish 3-4x/week" instead of "Every Monday/Wednesday at 9am"
  - "Educational blog" instead of actual blog URL
  - "Custom attribution model" instead of detailed algorithm
  - General practices: "GDPR-compliant storage" vs. specific vendors


CATEGORY D: TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
-------------------------------------
✗ POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - API keys, access tokens, passwords (OBVIOUSLY!)
  - Specific server configurations, IP addresses
  - Database schemas with proprietary data models
  - Security tool names and configurations
  - Exact technology stack (if competitive advantage)

✓ SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "[API_KEY_REDACTED]" placeholders
  - "Cloud-hosted database" vs. specific provider/region
  - Generic: "Authentication via OAuth 2.0" vs. implementation details
  - "Industry-standard security practices" for confidential setups


CATEGORY E: FINANCIAL INFORMATION
----------------------------------
✗ BE CAUTIOUS WITH:
  - Exact annual revenue or profit margins
  - Specific client payment amounts
  - Banking information, credit card details
  - Negotiated rates or special pricing

✓ SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Budget ranges: "$500-1000/month" instead of $847.32
  - "Standard tier pricing" vs. negotiated enterprise discount
  - Percentage allocation: "15% of revenue" vs. dollar amount
  - "Competitive market rate" for pricing discussions

=============================================================================
SECTION 2: STEP-BY-STEP REDACTION PROCESS
=============================================================================

STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR DOCUMENT
------------------------------
1. Create a COPY of your original assessment (never redact the only version)
2. Save copy with clear naming: "tool-stack-assessment-REDACTED-2026-02-12.md"
3. Keep original in secure location (encrypted drive, password-protected)

STEP 2: AUTOMATED FIND-AND-REPLACE
-----------------------------------
Before manual review, use find-and-replace for obvious items:

Search for:                    Replace with:
-----------                    -------------
[Your Name]                    [User] or [Content Creator]
[Your Company]                 [Company] or [Organization]
[Client Name 1]                [Client A - Industry]
[Client Name 2]                [Client B - Industry]
[Your Email]                   user@example.com
[Your Website]                 example.com
[City, State]                  [Region] or [EU/US]
$[Exact Amount]                $[Rounded Range]

STEP 3: MANUAL CONTEXTUAL REVIEW
---------------------------------
Read through document line by line:

[ ] Check every proper noun - is it identifying?
[ ] Review all numbers - do they reveal sensitive metrics?
[ ] Examine workflow descriptions - any proprietary processes?
[ ] Scan for inadvertent details (e.g., "our patented X method")
[ ] Look for unique combinations (even generic info can identify when combined)

STEP 4: CATEGORY-SPECIFIC PASSES
---------------------------------
Make dedicated passes for each category:

Pass 1 - PII Sweep:
  Focus exclusively on personal information
  Use "Find" for: your name variations, email patterns, phone numbers

Pass 2 - Client/Business Sweep:
  Replace all client names with generic labels
  Verify no identifying project details remain

Pass 3 - Financial Sweep:
  Round all exact dollar amounts
  Convert to ranges where possible
  Remove account/transaction specifics

Pass 4 - Technical Sweep:
  Remove or genericize infrastructure details
  Redact any credentials, keys, or tokens
  Replace specific tools with categories if competitively sensitive

STEP 5: PATTERN RECOGNITION CHECK
----------------------------------
Look for identifying patterns:

✗ RISKY PATTERNS:
  "Our team of 7 engineers in Austin building AI for healthcare compliance"
  → Too specific, possibly identifying even without company name

✓ SAFER VERSION:
  "Small engineering team (5-10) in US building healthcare compliance tools"
  → Generic enough to maintain privacy

✗ RISKY NUMBERS:
  "47.3% YoY growth, 1,247 customers, $847K ARR"
  → Highly specific, possibly matchable to public data

✓ SAFER VERSION:
  "40-50% YoY growth, 1K-1.5K customers, $750K-1M ARR"
  → Ranges prevent exact matching

STEP 6: THIRD-PARTY TOOL CHECK
-------------------------------
If using AI tools for assistance with your assessment:

1. Verify AI tool's privacy policy BEFORE pasting any content
2. Use tools with opt-out of training (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT with data controls off)
3. Even with privacy features, still redact per this guide (defense in depth)
4. Never paste:
   - Unredacted client information
   - Proprietary methodologies
   - Confidential financial data
   - Any regulated data (PHI, PCI, etc.)

STEP 7: PEER REVIEW (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
-----------------------------------------------
If possible, have colleague review:

1. Someone unfamiliar with your business
2. Ask: "Can you identify me or my clients from this?"
3. Ask: "What additional details would you redact?"
4. Incorporate feedback before sharing with AI or documenting

STEP 8: FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST
-----------------------------------
[ ] No full names (yours or others)
[ ] No real client/company names
[ ] No contact information (email, phone, address)
[ ] No exact financial figures (use ranges)
[ ] No proprietary process details
[ ] No API keys, passwords, or credentials
[ ] No URLs to non-public resources
[ ] No unreleased product information
[ ] No identifying combination of generic facts
[ ] Document clearly marked "REDACTED VERSION - NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION"

=============================================================================
SECTION 3: PRIVACY BEST PRACTICES
=============================================================================

PRINCIPLE 1: MINIMAL DISCLOSURE
--------------------------------
Share only what's necessary for the task:

- Getting AI tool recommendations? → Share workflow types, not client details
- Building implementation plan? → Share constraints, not business strategy
- Privacy evaluation? → Share requirements, not actual data you'll process

Ask yourself: "Does the AI need THIS specific detail to help me?"
If no, redact it.


PRINCIPLE 2: DEFENSE IN DEPTH
------------------------------
Multiple layers of protection:

Layer 1: Use privacy-respecting AI tools (opt-out of training)
Layer 2: Redact sensitive information per this guide
Layer 3: Use generic examples instead of real data
Layer 4: Keep truly confidential work offline entirely

Don't rely on just one layer.


PRINCIPLE 3: TIME-BASED SENSITIVITY
------------------------------------
Information sensitivity changes over time:

HIGH SENSITIVITY (Redact heavily):
  - Unreleased products/features
  - Active negotiations or partnerships
  - Current competitive strategies
  - Real-time operational data

MODERATE SENSITIVITY (Use judgment):
  - Released products (public but maybe not widely known)
  - Historical performance data (6+ months old)
  - General workflow approaches

LOW SENSITIVITY (Minimal redaction):
  - Public information (already on your website)
  - Industry-standard practices
  - Publicly announced partnerships


PRINCIPLE 4: CONTEXT MATTERS
-----------------------------
Same information, different sensitivity based on context:

"I manage 5 clients" → Low sensitivity (generic capability)

"I manage 5 healthcare clients in California requiring HIPAA compliance,
each paying $5K/month, with contracts renewing in Q2"
→ HIGH sensitivity (specific, combinable, competitive intel)


PRINCIPLE 5: REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
-----------------------------------
If you operate in regulated industries:

GDPR (EU):
  - Redact all personal data of EU residents
  - Document lawful basis for any processing
  - Honor data minimization principle

HIPAA (US Healthcare):
  - Never include Protected Health Information (PHI)
  - Redact anything that could identify patients
  - Use only de-identified data sets

PCI DSS (Payment Cards):
  - Never include full credit card numbers
  - Redact CVV, expiration dates, cardholder names
  - Use tokenized references only

CCPA (California):
  - Redact California resident personal information
  - Document opt-out mechanisms
  - Minimize data collection in assessments

=============================================================================
SECTION 4: REDACTION EXAMPLES
=============================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: CLIENT DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
❌ BEFORE (Too Specific):
"I create content for TechStartup Inc, a series B SaaS company in San Francisco
with 50 employees, focusing on AI-powered customer support. They pay me $8,500/month
for 12 blog posts and 40 social media posts."

✅ AFTER (Properly Redacted):
"I create content for a mid-stage SaaS client in the customer support technology
space. Monthly retainer in the $7.5K-10K range for 10-15 blog posts and 30-50
social media posts."


EXAMPLE 2: WORKFLOW DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------
❌ BEFORE (Reveals Proprietary Process):
"Our proprietary Content Velocity Framework uses a 3-tier classification system:
Tier 1 content gets the Premium Research Package (6-8 hours, $1,200 value),
Tier 2 gets Standard Package (3-4 hours, $600 value), Tier 3 gets templates only."

✅ AFTER (Generic Description):
"We use a tiered content classification system that allocates research and
development resources based on content strategic value. Higher-tier content
receives more intensive research and polish."


EXAMPLE 3: TECHNICAL SETUP
---------------------------
❌ BEFORE (Too Much Infrastructure Detail):
"We host on AWS us-east-1, using RDS PostgreSQL 14.2 with multi-AZ deployment.
API keys stored in AWS Secrets Manager. Authentication via Auth0 with custom
domain auth.ourcompany.com. Backup to S3 bucket 'companyname-backups-prod'."

✅ AFTER (Appropriate Generalization):
"Cloud-hosted infrastructure with managed database services. Credentials managed
via cloud-native secrets management. Third-party authentication service with
SSO capabilities. Automated backups to cloud storage."


EXAMPLE 4: FINANCIAL INFORMATION
---------------------------------
❌ BEFORE (Exact Figures):
"Current MRR: $47,332. Annual run rate: $567,984. Tool costs: $2,847/month.
Net margin: 83.2%. Client A pays $8,500, Client B pays $12,000, Client C pays $6,200."

✅ AFTER (Ranges and Percentages):
"Current MRR: $45-50K. Annual run rate: $550-600K. Tool costs: ~$3K/month.
Net margin: 80-85%. Client retainers range from $5-15K/month with median around $8-10K."


EXAMPLE 5: PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------
❌ BEFORE (Identifies Specific Clients):
"Hospital System X requires HIPAA compliance. Legal firm Y requires attorney-client
privilege protections. Government contractor Z requires FedRAMP moderate."

✅ AFTER (Generic Requirements):
"Work with healthcare clients requiring HIPAA compliance, legal industry clients
with attorney-client privilege requirements, and government contractors with
federal compliance standards."

=============================================================================
SECTION 5: COMMON REDACTION MISTAKES
=============================================================================

MISTAKE 1: Incomplete Find-and-Replace
---------------------------------------
Issue: Replacing "TechCorp" but missing "TechCorp's" and "TechCorp.com"
Fix: Use wildcards or multiple search variations

MISTAKE 2: Metadata Leakage
----------------------------
Issue: Document properties still contain author name, company
Fix: Check File → Properties/Info and clear metadata before sharing

MISTAKE 3: Forgetting Screenshots/Images
-----------------------------------------
Issue: Redacting text but leaving identifying screenshots
Fix: Review all embedded images, redact or remove

MISTAKE 4: Overly Specific "Generic" Examples
----------------------------------------------
Issue: "A healthcare company with 200 beds in Nashville" is still too specific
Fix: "A mid-sized healthcare provider in the Southeast US"

MISTAKE 5: Relative References
-------------------------------
Issue: "Our main competitor just raised $50M Series C"
Fix: Even without naming them, this might identify your company
     Better: "Competitors in space are well-funded (Series B-C stage)"

MISTAKE 6: Unique Combinations
-------------------------------
Issue: Each fact alone is generic, but combination identifies you
       "AI tool, healthcare, California, 5-10 employees, founded 2022"
Fix: Further genericize at least one dimension to break unique fingerprint

MISTAKE 7: Timeline Details
----------------------------
Issue: "We launched this feature on July 15, 2025 and saw 47% uptick"
Fix: "We launched this feature in Q3 2025 and saw 40-50% uptick"
     (Removing exact date makes correlation harder)

=============================================================================

=============================================================================
SECTION 7: REDACTION TOOLS & TECHNIQUES
=============================================================================

MANUAL REDACTION (Most Secure)
-------------------------------
Tools: Text editor, word processor
Method: Copy content, find-and-replace sensitive terms
Pros: Full control, no third-party exposure
Cons: Time-consuming, risk of human error


AUTOMATED REDACTION TOOLS
--------------------------
1. Document Redaction Software
   - Adobe Acrobat Pro (PDF redaction)
   - Microsoft Word (built-in redaction features)
   - Pros: Permanent removal, metadata cleaning
   - Cons: Primarily for PDFs, cost

2. PII Detection Tools
   - Microsoft Presidio (open source)
   - AWS Comprehend (detects PII)
   - Google Cloud DLP API
   - Pros: Catches patterns you might miss
   - Cons: Requires technical setup, cloud processing

3. Regex Find-and-Replace
   - Email pattern: \b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b
   - Phone: \b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b
   - SSN: \b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b
   - Pros: Fast, consistent
   - Cons: Can't catch contextual sensitivity


VERIFICATION TOOLS
------------------
After redaction, verify with:
1. PII scanners (run redacted doc through detector)
2. Diff tools (compare original vs. redacted to confirm changes)
3. Peer review (have colleague attempt to identify you)

=============================================================================
SUPPORT & QUESTIONS
=============================================================================

If you're unsure whether to redact something: REDACT IT.
Better to be overly cautious than expose sensitive information.

For regulatory compliance questions, always consult:
- Your organization's legal team
- Privacy officer or DPO (Data Protection Officer)
- Compliance department
- Industry-specific regulatory advisors
