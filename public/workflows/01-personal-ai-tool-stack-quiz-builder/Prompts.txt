3. Integration opportunities
4. Quick-win optimizations
5. Long-term strategic additions

Include rating scales (1-10) where appropriate.


PROMPT 3 - TOOL RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
--------------------------------------
I completed an AI tool needs assessment. Based on my responses below, recommend 15-20 AI tools organized by:
- Essential (must-have for my workflows)
- High-value (significant productivity impact)
- Nice-to-have (optimization opportunities)
- Experimental (emerging capabilities to watch)

For each recommendation, provide:
- Tool name and category
- Primary use case for my needs
- Privacy rating (1-10)
- Approximate cost
- 2-3 alternatives

My assessment responses:
[PASTE YOUR QUIZ ANSWERS]


PROMPT 4 - PRIVACY-FIRST EVALUATION
------------------------------------
I'm evaluating AI tools with strong privacy requirements. For each tool I list, analyze:

1. Data residency (where data is processed/stored)
2. Third-party data sharing practices
3. Data retention policies
4. User data deletion capabilities
5. Compliance certifications (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)
6. Privacy policy red flags
7. Overall privacy score (1-10)

Tools to evaluate:
[LIST TOOLS]

Provide findings in a comparison table format. Flag any tools that should be avoided for privacy-sensitive work.


PROMPT 5 - IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP BUILDER
------------------------------------------
I've selected the following AI tools for my stack:
[LIST YOUR SELECTED TOOLS]

Create a 6-month phased implementation roadmap:

Phase 1 (Month 1): Quick wins and essential tools
Phase 2 (Months 2-3): Integration and workflow optimization
Phase 3 (Months 4-6): Advanced capabilities and experimentation

For each phase, include:
- Specific tools to implement (in order)
- Estimated setup time per tool
- Integration dependencies
- Success metrics
- Potential blockers to watch for

Format as a Gantt-style timeline with clear milestones.


PROMPT 6 - COST-BENEFIT ANALYZER
---------------------------------
Analyze the total cost of ownership for my proposed AI tool stack:

Tools and pricing:
[LIST TOOLS WITH MONTHLY/ANNUAL COSTS]

Calculate:
1. Monthly recurring costs (base + projected usage)
2. Annual costs with volume discounts
3. One-time setup/migration costs
4. Training time costs (estimate my hourly rate at $[X])
5. Integration/API costs

Then estimate ROI based on:
- Time savings per tool (hours/week)
- Quality improvements
- Error reduction
- Automation opportunities

Provide 1-year and 3-year ROI projections. Highlight which tools offer fastest payback.


PROMPT 7 - INTEGRATION STRATEGY PLANNER
----------------------------------------
I'm building an AI tool stack with these tools:
[LIST YOUR TOOLS]

Design an integration strategy covering:

1. Data flow mapping: What data moves between which tools?
2. Integration methods: Native integrations, automation platforms (Zapier/Make), API connections, or manual processes?
3. Authentication strategy: SSO, individual logins, API keys?
4. Data synchronization: Real-time vs. scheduled vs. manual?
5. Backup strategy: Where is data duplicated for safety?
6. Export/migration plan: How do I get data out if I switch tools?

Create a visual data flow diagram (text-based) and integration checklist.


PROMPT 8 - WORKFLOW-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDER
-----------------------------------------
I need AI tool recommendations specifically for this workflow:

Workflow description: [DESCRIBE YOUR SPECIFIC WORKFLOW]
Current process: [CURRENT STEPS]
Pain points: [SPECIFIC PROBLEMS]
Volume: [HOW OFTEN/HOW MUCH]
Stakeholders: [WHO'S INVOLVED]

Recommend 5-8 AI tools that could optimize this workflow. For each:
- How it addresses specific pain points
- Where it fits in the workflow (which steps)
- Integration requirements with existing tools
- Learning curve estimate
- Expected time savings
- Privacy considerations for this use case

Prioritize tools that work well together as a complementary set.


PROMPT 9 - COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS GENERATOR
------------------------------------------
I'm deciding between multiple AI tools in the same category. Create a detailed comparison:

Category: [e.g., AI writing assistants, code completion, image generation]
Tools to compare: [LIST 3-5 TOOLS]

Compare across:
1. Core capabilities and limitations
2. Pricing tiers and value proposition
3. Privacy and data handling
4. Integration ecosystem
5. Output quality (based on public benchmarks)
6. User experience and learning curve
7. API access and automation potential
8. Community and support quality
9. Long-term viability (company stability)
10. Lock-in risk and export capabilities

Conclude with a recommendation matrix: "Choose Tool A if [conditions], Tool B if [conditions]"


PROMPT 10 - QUARTERLY STACK REVIEW
-----------------------------------
I implemented an AI tool stack 3 months ago. Help me conduct a quarterly review:

Current stack:
[LIST TOOLS WITH USAGE FREQUENCY]

Review framework:
1. Utilization analysis: Which tools am I actually using vs. paying for?
2. Value assessment: Which tools deliver measurable value?
3. Redundancy check: Any overlapping capabilities?
4. Gap identification: New needs that emerged?
5. Privacy incidents: Any concerns or policy changes?
6. Cost optimization: Any pricing changes or better alternatives?
7. Integration health: What's working/broken?
8. Emerging alternatives: New tools worth evaluating?

Provide actionable recommendations:
- Tools to eliminate (underutilized or redundant)
- Tools to upgrade/downgrade
- New tools to trial
- Integration improvements
- Cost savings opportunities

Generate a refined tool stack for the next quarter.


==============================================================================
USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

1. CUSTOMIZATION: Replace bracketed placeholders [LIKE THIS] with your specific information before using prompts.

2. PROMPT CHAINING: For best results, use prompts in sequence:
   - Start with Prompt 1 or 2 (quiz generation)
   - Move to Prompt 3 (recommendations)
   - Then Prompt 4 (privacy check)
   - Follow with Prompt 5-7 (implementation planning)
   - Use Prompt 10 quarterly for ongoing optimization

3. PRIVACY PROTECTION: Never include:
   - Proprietary business information
   - Client/customer names or details
   - Specific financial data (use ranges)
   - Internal project codenames
   - Confidential workflow details
   Use generic descriptions and anonymized examples.

4. AI TOOL COMPATIBILITY: These prompts work with:
   - ChatGPT (GPT-4 or higher recommended)
   - Claude (Sonnet or Opus)
   - Gemini Advanced
   - Perplexity Pro
   - Any LLM with sufficient context window (8k+ tokens)

5. ITERATION: If results aren't specific enough, follow up with:
   "Can you make this more specific to [your domain]?"
   "Provide 3 concrete examples for each recommendation"
   "Focus specifically on [aspect] in more detail"

6. OUTPUT FORMATTING: Request specific formats:
   "Provide this as a markdown table"
   "Format as a checklist I can copy to my task manager"
   "Create a CSV-compatible output"

7. VERIFICATION: Always independently verify:
   - Tool pricing (check official websites)
   - Privacy claims (read actual privacy policies)
   - Integration capabilities (check documentation)
   - Compliance certifications (verify on vendor sites)

8. TEMPORAL AWARENESS: AI training data has cutoff dates. For latest tools:
   "Are there any tools released after [AI's knowledge cutoff] I should consider?"
   Then manually research recommendations.

9. BIAS AWARENESS: AI may favor:
   - Well-known tools over niche alternatives
   - Tools with extensive online discussion
   - Recently hyped solutions
   Balance AI recommendations with independent research and user reviews.

10. SAVE YOUR OUTPUTS: Keep all AI-generated assessments for:
    - Future quarterly reviews
    - Comparison when needs change
    - Documentation of decision rationale
    - Onboarding new team members
