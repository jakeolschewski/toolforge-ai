CONTENT IDEA GENERATOR - PROMPT VARIATIONS
=============================================

PROMPT 1 - AUDIENCE-DRIVEN IDEA GENERATION
-------------------------------------------
I need content ideas for my [FILL_IN_INDUSTRY/NICHE] audience. Here is what I know about them:

- Primary audience segment: [FILL_IN_AUDIENCE_DESCRIPTION]
- Their biggest pain points: [FILL_IN_PAIN_POINTS]
- Content pillars we focus on: [FILL_IN_CONTENT_PILLARS]
- Content formats that perform best: [FILL_IN_FORMATS]

Generate 20 content ideas that directly address audience needs. For each idea, include:
1. Working title
2. Target audience segment
3. Content format (blog, video, infographic, etc.)
4. Primary pain point addressed
5. Suggested angle or hook

Prioritize ideas that fill gaps in our current content library.


PROMPT 2 - TREND-BASED IDEA EXPANSION
--------------------------------------
I've identified the following trending topics in my industry:

- Trend 1: [FILL_IN_TREND]
- Trend 2: [FILL_IN_TREND]
- Trend 3: [FILL_IN_TREND]

My brand focuses on [FILL_IN_BRAND_FOCUS] and our audience cares about [FILL_IN_AUDIENCE_INTERESTS].

For each trend, generate 5 content ideas that connect the trend to our brand's expertise. Include:
1. Content title
2. Angle that differentiates from obvious coverage
3. Why this is timely
4. Evergreen potential (can it be updated later?)
5. Suggested call-to-action


PROMPT 3 - COMPETITIVE GAP ANALYSIS
------------------------------------
I've reviewed competitor content in my niche. Here are topics they cover heavily:

- [FILL_IN_COMPETITOR_TOPICS]

And here are areas they seem to neglect:

- [FILL_IN_NEGLECTED_AREAS]

My unique expertise is in [FILL_IN_UNIQUE_EXPERTISE]. Generate 15 content ideas that target the gaps my competitors are missing. For each idea, explain:
1. Why competitors likely skip this topic
2. Why our audience would value it
3. How our unique expertise makes us credible on this topic
4. Suggested content format and length


PROMPT 4 - CONTENT PILLAR BRAINSTORM
-------------------------------------
My content strategy is built around these pillars:

1. [FILL_IN_PILLAR_1]
2. [FILL_IN_PILLAR_2]
3. [FILL_IN_PILLAR_3]
4. [FILL_IN_PILLAR_4]

For each pillar, generate a "hub and spoke" content plan:
- 1 comprehensive hub piece (pillar page or ultimate guide)
- 5 spoke pieces that link back to the hub
- 2 frequently asked questions that could become standalone pieces

Total output should be at least 32 content ideas across all pillars.


PROMPT 5 - QUESTION-STACKING IDEATION
--------------------------------------
My audience frequently asks about [FILL_IN_BROAD_TOPIC]. Using the question-stacking technique, generate content ideas by exploring these angles:

- HOW questions (tutorials, processes)
- WHY questions (reasoning, benefits, motivations)
- WHAT questions (definitions, comparisons, explanations)
- WHEN questions (timing, scheduling, seasonal)
- WHO questions (personas, case studies, interviews)

Generate at least 4 content ideas per question type (20 total). Format each as a working headline with a one-sentence description of the angle.


PROMPT 6 - SEASONAL AND EVENT-DRIVEN IDEAS
-------------------------------------------
I need content ideas tied to upcoming events and seasonal moments:

- Upcoming dates/events: [FILL_IN_DATES_AND_EVENTS]
- Industry conferences or launches: [FILL_IN_INDUSTRY_EVENTS]
- Seasonal patterns in our business: [FILL_IN_SEASONAL_PATTERNS]
- My niche: [FILL_IN_NICHE]

Generate 15 time-sensitive content ideas with:
1. Title
2. Target publish date (relative to event)
3. Why this timing matters
4. How to make the piece semi-evergreen after the event passes
5. Promotion strategy for maximum timeliness impact


PROMPT 7 - REPURPOSING-READY IDEA GENERATION
---------------------------------------------
I want content ideas that are specifically designed to be repurposed across multiple formats. My available channels are:

- [FILL_IN_CHANNELS, e.g., blog, YouTube, LinkedIn, newsletter, podcast]

Generate 10 "anchor content" ideas in my niche of [FILL_IN_NICHE] where each idea includes:
1. Original format and title
2. 3-4 repurposed formats with adapted titles
3. Key message that stays consistent across formats
4. Unique angle for each format (not just copy-paste)
5. Estimated production effort for each version


PROMPT 8 - DATA-DRIVEN IDEA VALIDATION
---------------------------------------
I have the following content performance data from the past [FILL_IN_TIME_PERIOD]:

- Top-performing topics: [FILL_IN_TOP_TOPICS]
- Underperforming topics: [FILL_IN_UNDERPERFORMING_TOPICS]
- Highest engagement formats: [FILL_IN_FORMATS]
- Audience growth sources: [FILL_IN_SOURCES]

Based on this data, generate 15 content ideas that:
1. Double down on proven topic areas with fresh angles
2. Avoid patterns from underperforming content
3. Use the formats that drive the most engagement
4. Include 3 experimental ideas that test new territory

For each idea, explain the data-driven rationale behind it.


PROMPT 9 - BUYER JOURNEY CONTENT MAPPING
-----------------------------------------
I sell [FILL_IN_PRODUCT_OR_SERVICE] to [FILL_IN_TARGET_AUDIENCE]. Map content ideas to each stage of the buyer journey:

**Awareness Stage** (prospect realizes they have a problem):
- Generate 5 educational content ideas

**Consideration Stage** (prospect evaluates solutions):
- Generate 5 comparison/evaluation content ideas

**Decision Stage** (prospect is ready to buy):
- Generate 5 conversion-focused content ideas

**Retention Stage** (customer needs ongoing value):
- Generate 5 retention and loyalty content ideas

For each idea, include the title, format, and one key metric to track success.


PROMPT 10 - CONTRARIAN AND COUNTERINTUITIVE IDEAS
--------------------------------------------------
In my industry of [FILL_IN_INDUSTRY], the conventional wisdom says:

1. [FILL_IN_CONVENTIONAL_WISDOM_1]
2. [FILL_IN_CONVENTIONAL_WISDOM_2]
3. [FILL_IN_CONVENTIONAL_WISDOM_3]

Generate 10 contrarian content ideas that challenge these assumptions with evidence-based arguments. For each idea:
1. State the conventional wisdom being challenged
2. Provide a compelling counter-argument headline
3. Outline 3 supporting points or data sources to research
4. Explain why this contrarian take serves the audience (not just clickbait)
5. Rate the controversy level (mild, moderate, bold) and potential risk
