REDACTION GUIDE - CONTENT IDEA GENERATOR
==========================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide helps you remove sensitive, proprietary, or personally identifiable
information (PII) when using AI tools for content ideation, sharing idea
documents with collaborators, or storing ideation outputs externally.

=============================================================================
SECTION 1: TYPES OF DATA TO REDACT
=============================================================================

CATEGORY A: AUDIENCE AND ANALYTICS DATA
-----------------------------------------
x NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Specific website traffic numbers or unique visitor counts
  - Exact conversion rates or revenue-per-content figures
  - Individual customer names, emails, or survey responses
  - Proprietary audience segmentation models
  - Internal dashboard screenshots or analytics exports

SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Use ranges: "10K-50K monthly visitors" instead of exact numbers
  - Use percentages: "Conversion improved 15%" without base figures
  - Anonymize survey quotes: "A mid-career professional said..."
  - Describe segments generically: "Tech-savvy professionals, 25-40"
  - Reference trends: "Traffic increased quarter-over-quarter"


CATEGORY B: COMPETITIVE AND STRATEGIC INFORMATION
---------------------------------------------------
x NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Real competitor names in AI prompts
  - Proprietary competitive analysis reports
  - Internal strategic priorities or roadmaps
  - Unreleased product or feature information
  - Pricing strategies or margin data

SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Use labels: "Competitor A (large SaaS)", "Competitor B (boutique agency)"
  - Describe competitive landscape generically: "Market leaders focus on X"
  - Reference publicly available information only
  - Use hypothetical scenarios: "If a competitor launched..."
  - Generalize strategy: "Growth-focused" instead of specific targets


CATEGORY C: BRAND AND CLIENT DETAILS
--------------------------------------
x NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Client brand names or project codenames
  - Internal brand guidelines documents verbatim
  - Unpublished campaign details or launch dates
  - Client-specific performance benchmarks
  - Agency-client contractual terms

SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Use industry descriptors: "B2B healthcare client"
  - Reference brand voice generically: "Professional, authoritative tone"
  - Use approximate timelines: "Launching next quarter"
  - Share anonymized case results: "Client saw 2x engagement increase"
  - Describe scope broadly: "Content strategy engagement"


=============================================================================
SECTION 2: STEP-BY-STEP REDACTION PROCESS
=============================================================================

STEP 1: IDENTIFY SENSITIVE CONTENT
  - Review all ideation inputs (audience data, research notes, briefs)
  - Highlight any specific names, numbers, or proprietary details
  - Flag any content that could identify a client or internal strategy
  - Check for embedded metadata in documents or screenshots

STEP 2: APPLY CATEGORY-SPECIFIC REPLACEMENTS
  - Replace all Category A items with anonymized ranges or percentages
  - Replace all Category B items with generic competitor labels
  - Replace all Category C items with industry descriptors
  - Ensure replacements maintain enough context for useful AI output

STEP 3: VERIFY CONTEXT PRESERVATION
  - Re-read the redacted version to confirm it still makes sense
  - Ensure AI prompts will still generate relevant ideas with redacted inputs
  - Check that the strategic intent is preserved without exposing details
  - Test with a colleague: can they identify the real brand or client?

STEP 4: DOCUMENT REDACTION MAPPING
  - Create a private mapping file (kept locally, never shared with AI)
  - Map each placeholder to its real value: "Competitor A = [Real Name]"
  - Store mapping in a secure, access-controlled location
  - Update mapping when new items are redacted

STEP 5: FINAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL
  - Conduct a final read-through of all redacted materials
  - Confirm no PII, proprietary data, or strategic details remain
  - Get a second pair of eyes if dealing with highly sensitive content
  - Approve materials for AI submission or external sharing


=============================================================================
SECTION 3: SCENARIO-SPECIFIC REDACTION
=============================================================================

SCENARIO 1: BRAINSTORMING WITH AI TOOLS
  Before submitting audience data to AI for idea generation:
  - Remove all specific analytics numbers
  - Replace brand names with generic descriptors
  - Anonymize any customer quotes or feedback
  - Use industry-level trends instead of proprietary insights

  Example Before:
    "Our Acme Corp blog gets 45,230 monthly visitors. Top post 'How Acme
    Widgets Save Time' got 12,400 views. CEO Jane Smith wants more content
    about enterprise widget deployment."

  Example After:
    "Our B2B technology blog gets 40K-50K monthly visitors. Top post about
    product time-savings got 10K-15K views. Leadership wants more content
    about enterprise deployment use cases."


SCENARIO 2: SHARING IDEA LISTS WITH EXTERNAL COLLABORATORS
  Before sharing ideation outputs with freelancers or partners:
  - Remove internal scoring rationale that references strategy
  - Strip any notes about competitive positioning
  - Anonymize client-specific requirements
  - Remove internal deadlines tied to unreleased products

  Example Before:
    "Idea #3: Write comparison post beating Competitor X's SEO guide.
    Priority: High because Client Y's contract renewal depends on organic
    traffic growth by March 15. Budget: $2,400."

  Example After:
    "Idea #3: Write comprehensive SEO comparison guide in our niche.
    Priority: High based on audience demand for this topic. Budget:
    Standard rate for long-form content."


=============================================================================
SECTION 4: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

Before submitting any content ideation materials externally:

  [ ] All specific audience metrics replaced with ranges
  [ ] No real competitor names appear in the document
  [ ] No client names, project names, or codenames present
  [ ] Internal strategic priorities are generalized
  [ ] No PII (names, emails, phone numbers) from audience data
  [ ] No proprietary frameworks or methodologies named
  [ ] Embedded metadata stripped from any attached files
  [ ] Redaction mapping stored securely and separately
  [ ] Document reviewed by a second person (for sensitive materials)
  [ ] Content still provides enough context for its intended purpose
