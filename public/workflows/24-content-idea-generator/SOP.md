# Content Idea Generator - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview and Objectives

The Content Idea Generator is a structured workflow for producing a steady pipeline of high-quality content ideas aligned with your brand, audience interests, and strategic goals. Rather than relying on sporadic inspiration, this system turns idea generation into a repeatable, data-informed process that consistently feeds your editorial calendar.

This workflow combines audience research, trend analysis, and creative brainstorming frameworks to generate content ideas that resonate. By systematically capturing, evaluating, and prioritizing ideas, you ensure your content strategy remains proactive rather than reactive, and that every piece of content serves a clear purpose.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Build a sustainable content idea pipeline that never runs dry
- Align content ideas with audience needs and business goals
- Leverage trend data and competitive analysis to identify content gaps
- Create a scoring system to prioritize the highest-impact ideas
- Reduce creative bottlenecks and brainstorming fatigue

**Expected Outcomes:**
- A curated backlog of 30-50 content ideas per quarter
- Content ideas mapped to buyer journey stages and audience segments
- Competitive gap analysis revealing underserved topic areas
- Prioritized editorial calendar draft based on idea scoring
- Documented ideation process that any team member can replicate

**W.E.D.G.E Framework Integration:**
- **Workflow**: Systematizes the ideation process into repeatable steps with clear inputs and outputs
- **Education**: Teaches users how to identify audience pain points, spot trends, and evaluate content potential
- **Data**: Ensures no proprietary audience data, analytics, or competitive intelligence is exposed to AI tools
- **Guidance**: Provides scoring rubrics, brainstorming frameworks, and prioritization matrices
- **Empowerment**: Enables content creators to independently generate and evaluate ideas without relying on a single creative lead

## Prerequisites

- Access to audience data (analytics, surveys, or persona documents)
- Familiarity with your brand voice and content pillars
- List of existing content to identify gaps and avoid duplication
- Access to trend tools (Google Trends, social listening, or industry feeds)
- 45-60 minutes of focused brainstorming time

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Audience and Goal Alignment (5-10 minutes)

Define the target audience and strategic objectives for your content ideas:

- [ ] Identify 2-3 primary audience segments for this ideation round
- [ ] Review recent audience feedback, comments, or survey results
- [ ] Confirm current business goals (awareness, engagement, conversion, retention)
- [ ] List 3-5 content pillars or themes aligned with brand strategy
- [ ] Note any seasonal events, product launches, or campaigns on the horizon

**Output:** Audience and goal alignment brief

---

### Step 2: Trend and Gap Research (10-15 minutes)

Gather external signals that reveal what your audience cares about:

- [ ] Check Google Trends for rising topics in your niche
- [ ] Review competitor content published in the last 30 days
- [ ] Scan social media for frequently asked questions and discussions
- [ ] Identify content gaps where competitors are underserving the audience
- [ ] Note any emerging industry trends or news stories
- [ ] Document 10-15 raw topic signals from this research

**Output:** Trend and gap research notes

---

### Step 3: Structured Brainstorming (10-15 minutes)

Use proven frameworks to expand raw signals into specific content ideas:

- [ ] Apply the "Hub and Spoke" method to expand each topic signal into 3-5 subtopics
- [ ] Use the "Question Stacking" technique to generate how, why, what, and when angles
- [ ] Cross-reference topics with different content formats (listicle, guide, case study, comparison)
- [ ] Brainstorm contrarian or counterintuitive angles for popular topics
- [ ] Generate at least 25-30 raw content ideas from the brainstorming session
- [ ] Record all ideas without filtering at this stage

**Output:** Raw content idea list (25-30 ideas minimum)

---

### Step 4: Idea Scoring and Prioritization (10-15 minutes)

Evaluate and rank ideas using a consistent scoring rubric:

- [ ] Score each idea on Audience Relevance (1-5)
- [ ] Score each idea on Business Alignment (1-5)
- [ ] Score each idea on Uniqueness/Differentiation (1-5)
- [ ] Score each idea on Feasibility (time, resources, expertise) (1-5)
- [ ] Score each idea on Timeliness/Urgency (1-5)
- [ ] Calculate composite scores and rank ideas from highest to lowest
- [ ] Select the top 10-15 ideas for the editorial pipeline

**Output:** Scored and prioritized content idea list

---

### Step 5: Documentation and Calendar Integration (5-10 minutes)

Prepare selected ideas for production and schedule them:

- [ ] Write a 2-3 sentence brief for each selected idea (angle, audience, goal)
- [ ] Assign target content format and estimated word count or length
- [ ] Map ideas to editorial calendar dates based on priority and timeliness
- [ ] Identify any research, assets, or interviews needed before production
- [ ] Archive remaining ideas in the backlog for future ideation rounds

**Output:** Content briefs and updated editorial calendar

## Best Practices

1. Schedule ideation sessions on a recurring cadence (weekly or biweekly) rather than waiting for inspiration.
2. Separate brainstorming from evaluation to avoid premature filtering of creative ideas.
3. Involve team members from different functions (sales, support, product) for diverse perspectives.
4. Keep a running "idea capture" note for spontaneous ideas between formal sessions.
5. Review past content performance data before each session to inform what resonates.
6. Rotate brainstorming frameworks to prevent repetitive thinking patterns.
7. Aim for quantity first, quality second during the brainstorming phase.
8. Revisit and recycle archived ideas quarterly as market conditions change.
9. Validate top ideas with a quick audience poll or social media test when possible.
10. Document the rationale behind each selected idea to guide the writer during production.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Generating ideas without audience data.** *Solution:* Always start with audience research and real signals before brainstorming.
2. **Filtering too early during brainstorming.** *Solution:* Use a two-phase process where all ideas are captured first, then scored separately.
3. **Overweighting trending topics at the expense of evergreen content.** *Solution:* Maintain a balanced mix of timely and evergreen ideas in every batch.
4. **Ignoring competitor content.** *Solution:* Include a dedicated gap analysis step to find opportunities others are missing.
5. **Relying on a single person for all ideas.** *Solution:* Rotate facilitators and involve cross-functional contributors.
6. **Failing to document and archive unused ideas.** *Solution:* Maintain a backlog system so no idea is permanently lost.
7. **Not connecting ideas to business outcomes.** *Solution:* Score every idea against business alignment criteria.
8. **Letting the backlog grow stale.** *Solution:* Review and prune the backlog quarterly, removing outdated ideas.
