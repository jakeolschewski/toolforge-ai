REDACTION GUIDE - GOAL BREAKDOWN & MILESTONE MAPPER
====================================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide helps you safely share goal breakdowns, milestone roadmaps, and progress
reports with AI assistants or external parties without exposing confidential business
strategies, personnel details, or proprietary plans.

=============================================================================
SECTION 1: TYPES OF DATA TO REDACT
=============================================================================

CATEGORY A: STRATEGIC GOALS AND PLANS (USE PLACEHOLDERS)
---------------------------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Specific product launch plans or unreleased features
  - Acquisition or merger objectives
  - Competitive positioning strategies
  - Revenue targets or financial projections
  - Market expansion plans with specific geographies
  - Patent or IP development timelines
  - Partnership negotiations or deal terms
  - Pricing strategies or margin targets

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "Launch Product X by Q3" instead of specific product name
  - "Enter new market segment" instead of specific country/region
  - "Achieve revenue target" instead of "$2.5M ARR"
  - "Strategic partnership initiative" instead of naming the partner
  - "Competitive differentiation project" instead of specific strategy
  - Generic industry framing: "B2B SaaS product launch" vs. specifics

CATEGORY B: PERSONNEL AND ORGANIZATIONAL DETAILS
-------------------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Employee names, titles, or contact information
  - Team structures revealing organizational strategy
  - Hiring plans or headcount targets
  - Performance issues or personnel conflicts
  - Salary, compensation, or bonus information
  - Contractor names or consulting firm identities
  - Board member or investor names (if private)

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Roles: "Backend Developer," "Marketing Lead," "Project Manager"
  - Generic team size: "Team of 5 engineers" not individual names
  - "Team Member A," "Stakeholder B" for placeholder references
  - "Resource constraint: need 2 additional designers" vs. naming people
  - "Reporting to senior leadership" vs. specific executive names

CATEGORY C: FINANCIAL AND BUDGET DETAILS
-----------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Exact budget figures for confidential projects
  - Vendor costs or contract terms
  - Profit margins or unit economics
  - Funding runway or cash reserves
  - Investment amounts or valuation details
  - Client contract values

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Ranges: "$50K-100K budget" instead of "$73,500"
  - Relative: "20% of annual budget" instead of dollar amount
  - Categorical: "Low/Medium/High budget" for AI-assisted planning
  - "Within approved budget constraints" for status reports
  - "Cost-effective solution required" for resource planning prompts

CATEGORY D: CLIENT AND CUSTOMER INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Client or customer names
  - Contract details or SLAs
  - Customer-specific requirements or configurations
  - Sales pipeline or deal stage information
  - Customer data, metrics, or usage patterns
  - NDA-covered information

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "Enterprise Client A (healthcare vertical)"
  - "Customer segment: mid-market SaaS companies"
  - "Client requirement: HIPAA compliance" (generic compliance need)
  - "Key account" or "strategic partner" instead of names
  - "External stakeholder" for client-related milestones

CATEGORY E: TECHNICAL AND PROPRIETARY DETAILS
----------------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Proprietary algorithms or methodologies
  - System architecture revealing security posture
  - Internal tool names or custom platform details
  - API endpoints, credentials, or infrastructure specifics
  - Source code or technical specifications
  - Vulnerability details or security assessments

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "Custom internal platform" instead of specific tool name
  - "Cloud infrastructure" instead of specific provider/config
  - "Proprietary methodology" instead of the methodology itself
  - "Technical integration milestone" instead of architecture details
  - Generic descriptions: "database migration" vs. specific schema

=============================================================================
SECTION 2: STEP-BY-STEP REDACTION PROCESS
=============================================================================

STEP 1: PRE-REDACTION REVIEW
------------------------------
Before sharing any goal breakdown documentation with AI or externally:

[ ] Read through the entire document once for sensitive content
[ ] Search for company name and all brand names
[ ] Search for employee names and email addresses
[ ] Search for specific dollar amounts or financial figures
[ ] Search for client or customer names
[ ] Search for product codenames or unreleased feature names
[ ] Search for dates tied to confidential timelines (launch dates, deal closes)

STEP 2: GOAL AND SUB-GOAL ANONYMIZATION
-----------------------------------------
Replace specific goals with generic equivalents:

x BEFORE: "Launch WidgetPro 3.0 in the European market by June 2026,
           targeting 500 enterprise accounts at $50K ACV"
v AFTER:  "Launch Product X in new market by [TARGET DATE],
           targeting [NUMBER] enterprise accounts at [PRICE POINT]"

x BEFORE: "Acquire CompetitorCo's customer base through integration partnership"
v AFTER:  "Expand customer base through strategic partnership initiative"

x BEFORE: "Reduce churn from 8.2% to 4% by implementing ML-based prediction model"
v AFTER:  "Reduce churn metric to target level using predictive analytics"

STEP 3: MILESTONE DATE SANITIZATION
-------------------------------------
When dates reveal confidential timelines:

x BEFORE: "Milestone: Submit FDA approval application by March 15, 2026"
v AFTER:  "Milestone: Submit regulatory approval application by [TARGET DATE]"

For general planning advice, relative dates are acceptable:
v SAFE:   "Milestone 1: Week 2 - Research phase complete"
v SAFE:   "Milestone 2: End of Month 1 - Prototype ready"
v SAFE:   "Q2 target: Beta launch"

STEP 4: RESOURCE AND TEAM ANONYMIZATION
-----------------------------------------
Replace team specifics with generic roles:

x BEFORE: "Assign Sarah Chen (Senior DevOps) and Mike Johnson (Backend Lead)
           to infrastructure milestone. Sarah: 30hrs/week, Mike: 20hrs/week.
           Budget: $15,000 for AWS infrastructure."
v AFTER:  "Assign Senior DevOps Engineer and Backend Lead to infrastructure
           milestone. DevOps: 30hrs/week, Backend: 20hrs/week.
           Budget: $10K-20K range for cloud infrastructure."

STEP 5: PROGRESS AND METRIC ANONYMIZATION
-------------------------------------------
Sanitize progress reports and KPIs:

x BEFORE: "Revenue milestone: $1.2M MRR achieved (target: $1.5M).
           Customer count: 347 (target: 400). NPS: 62."
v AFTER:  "Revenue milestone: 80% of target achieved.
           Customer count: ~85% of target. NPS: above benchmark."

Use percentages, ranges, or relative indicators instead of absolute figures.

STEP 6: VISUAL ROADMAP SANITIZATION
-------------------------------------
When sharing screenshots or exports of roadmap visuals:

[ ] Blur or redact milestone names if they reveal confidential plans
[ ] Replace specific dates with relative timeframes if needed
[ ] Remove assignee names (show roles only)
[ ] Redact budget figures from resource views
[ ] Remove comments or notes that may contain sensitive context
[ ] Check for metadata in exported files (author name, organization)

STEP 7: FINAL VERIFICATION PASS
---------------------------------
After redaction, review the entire document one more time:

[ ] Read as if you are an outsider -- does anything reveal confidential info?
[ ] Check that placeholder naming is consistent throughout (same client = same placeholder)
[ ] Verify no sensitive data leaked into examples, footnotes, or comments
[ ] Confirm the document is still useful for its intended purpose after redaction
[ ] Have a second person review if the document will be shared externally

=============================================================================
SECTION 3: SCENARIO-SPECIFIC REDACTION
=============================================================================

SCENARIO 1: SHARING GOAL BREAKDOWN WITH AI ASSISTANT
-----------------------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Generic goal description (industry context, goal type)
v Number of sub-goals and their general nature
v Timeline structure (weeks, months, quarters)
v Generic resource descriptions (team size, skill types)

x Unconfirmed plans or speculative timelines

SCENARIO 4: USING GOAL BREAKDOWN AS TRAINING MATERIAL
------------------------------------------------------
Safe to include:
v Anonymized goal examples from completed projects

v Template structures and frameworks
v Best practices and lessons learned (anonymized)

Must redact:
x Real project names, dates, and outcomes
x Employee names in examples
x Actual budget figures or financial results
x Client or customer references
x Any information covered by NDAs

=============================================================================
SECTION 4: AUTOMATED REDACTION TOOLS
=============================================================================

COMMAND-LINE TOOLS
------------------
1. Regular Expression Replacement (sed):
   # Replace dollar amounts with ranges
   sed -E 's/\$[0-9,]+(\.[0-9]{2})?/[AMOUNT_REDACTED]/g' roadmap.txt

   # Replace email addresses
   sed -E 's/[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}/[EMAIL_REDACTED]/g' report.txt

   # Replace specific dates (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   sed -E 's/20[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}/[DATE]/g' timeline.txt

   # Replace names (requires custom name list)
   sed 's/Sarah Chen/[TEAM_MEMBER_A]/g; s/Mike Johnson/[TEAM_MEMBER_B]/g' plan.txt

2. Find and Replace in Bulk (Python):
   import re

   def redact_document(text, company_name, employee_names):
       # Replace company name
       text = text.replace(company_name, "[COMPANY]")

       # Replace employee names
       for i, name in enumerate(employee_names):
           text = text.replace(name, f"[TEAM_MEMBER_{chr(65+i)}]")

       # Replace dollar amounts
       text = re.sub(r'\$[\d,]+(\.\d{2})?', '[AMOUNT]', text)

       # Replace email addresses
       text = re.sub(r'[\w.+-]+@[\w-]+\.[\w.]+', '[EMAIL]', text)

       return text

3. Document Metadata Removal:
   # Remove metadata from PDF exports
   exiftool -all= roadmap.pdf

   # Remove metadata from Office documents
   # Use File > Info > Check for Issues > Inspect Document in MS Office

MANUAL VERIFICATION
-------------------
Automated tools cannot catch:
- Goals that implicitly reveal strategy (e.g., "enter the Japanese market")
- Team structures that reveal organizational priorities
- Timeline patterns that reveal product launch windows
- Milestone names that are codenames for confidential initiatives

Always manually review after automated redaction.

=============================================================================
SECTION 5: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

Before sharing any goal breakdown documentation:

[ ] All employee names replaced with roles or placeholders
[ ] Company name and brand names genericized
[ ] Client and customer names removed or anonymized
[ ] Financial figures converted to ranges or percentages
[ ] Product names and codenames replaced with generic labels
[ ] Specific dates replaced with relative timeframes (if needed)
[ ] Technical details abstracted to generic descriptions
[ ] Progress metrics shown as percentages, not absolute numbers
[ ] Visual roadmap screenshots scrubbed of sensitive labels
[ ] File metadata removed (author, organization, comments)
[ ] Contingency plans do not reveal exploitable vulnerabilities
[ ] Examples use fictional scenarios, not real projects
[ ] Placeholder naming is consistent throughout the document
[ ] Document reviewed by a second person before sharing

PEER REVIEW:
[ ] Second person reviewed document for missed sensitive content
[ ] Reviewer is not deeply familiar with the project (fresh perspective)

=============================================================================
SECTION 6: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
=============================================================================

AI ASSISTANT INTERACTIONS
-------------------------
When using AI tools to help with goal breakdown:
- Provide enough context for useful output without revealing secrets
- Use industry-generic framing: "a B2B SaaS startup" vs. your company name
- Test with a small, non-sensitive goal first to calibrate redaction needs
- Remember that AI conversation logs may be retained by providers
- Use privacy-respecting modes when available (e.g., opt-out of training)

MULTI-STAKEHOLDER ENVIRONMENTS
-------------------------------
When sharing goal breakdowns across organizational boundaries:
- Create separate versions with different redaction levels per audience
- Internal team version: minimal redaction (names, roles visible)
- Leadership version: moderate redaction (aggregate metrics, no individual details)
- External version: maximum redaction (generic descriptions only)
- Label each version clearly to prevent accidental sharing of wrong version

COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------
GDPR: Redact all personal data (names, emails) in any externally shared document
HIPAA: Never include PHI in goal breakdowns, even as examples
SOX: Financial projections and targets may require restricted distribution
SEC: Material non-public information must not appear in shared documents
NDA: Cross-reference any NDAs before sharing goal details with third parties

ARCHIVAL AND VERSION CONTROL
-----------------------------
- Keep unredacted originals in secure, access-controlled storage
- Maintain a redaction log: what was changed, when, and for which audience
- When updating roadmaps, re-apply redaction to any newly added content
- Destroyed or archived redacted versions when no longer needed
- Treat redacted documents as still sensitive (redaction reduces but does not eliminate risk)

=============================================================================
SUPPORT & QUESTIONS
=============================================================================

When in doubt: REDACT IT.
Over-redaction is always safer than under-redaction.

For sensitive situations, consult:
- Legal team before sharing strategy documents externally
- HR before sharing documents containing personnel information
- Finance before sharing budget or revenue details
- Security team before sharing technical architecture or infrastructure

This guide is for educational purposes. Adapt to your organization's
specific security policies, NDAs, and regulatory requirements.
