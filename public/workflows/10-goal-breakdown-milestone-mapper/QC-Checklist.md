# Quality Control Checklist - Goal Breakdown & Milestone Mapper

## Pre-Implementation Verification

### 1. Goal Definition Quality
- [ ] Big goal is stated in one clear, concise sentence
- [ ] SMART criteria applied (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- [ ] Success indicator is defined (what "done" looks like)
- [ ] Motivation and strategic alignment documented
- [ ] Overall timeline established with start and end dates

- [ ] Known constraints listed (budget, team, technology, dependencies)
- [ ] Current state documented (starting point baseline)

### 2. Sub-Goal Decomposition Completeness
- [ ] 3-7 sub-goals identified (not too few, not too many)
- [ ] Sub-goals are mutually exclusive (no overlap between them)
- [ ] Sub-goals are collectively exhaustive (completing all achieves the big goal)
- [ ] Each sub-goal has a clear, one-sentence description
- [ ] Each sub-goal has a measurable success criterion
- [ ] Duration estimates include optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic ranges

- [ ] No sub-goal is so large it needs further decomposition

### 3. Sub-Goal Validation
- [ ] All sub-goals together fully achieve the big goal (no gaps)

## Milestone Quality Control

### 4. Milestone Definition Accuracy

- No progress tracking mechanism is configured
- Team members have not been briefed on their assignments

**ESCALATE for additional review if:**
