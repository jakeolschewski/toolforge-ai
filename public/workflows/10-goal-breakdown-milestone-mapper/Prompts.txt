GOAL BREAKDOWN & MILESTONE MAPPER - PROMPT VARIATIONS
======================================================

PROMPT 1 - GOAL DECOMPOSITION
------------------------------
Break down the following big goal into structured sub-goals with clear deliverables:

Big Goal: [DESCRIBE YOUR GOAL - e.g., "Launch a new SaaS product by Q3 2026"]
Timeline: [OVERALL DEADLINE OR TIMEFRAME]
Context: [RELEVANT BACKGROUND - e.g., team size, industry, current state]
Constraints: [KNOWN LIMITATIONS - e.g., budget cap, team availability, technology stack]

For each sub-goal, provide:
1. Sub-goal name and one-sentence description
2. Measurable success criterion (how do I know it's done?)
3. Estimated duration (optimistic, realistic, pessimistic)
4. Dependencies on other sub-goals
5. Key risks or assumptions
6. Priority level (critical path vs. parallel work)

Organize sub-goals in recommended execution order. Aim for 4-7 sub-goals that are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.


PROMPT 2 - MILESTONE TIMELINE MAPPER
-------------------------------------
Map milestones with specific dates for the following goal and timeline:

Goal: [YOUR GOAL]
Sub-Goals: [LIST YOUR SUB-GOALS or say "use the breakdown from our previous conversation"]
Start Date: [WHEN YOU BEGIN]
End Date: [TARGET COMPLETION DATE]
Work Capacity: [e.g., "Full-time solo," "Team of 4, each 20 hrs/week," etc.]

For each sub-goal, generate 2-3 milestones including:
1. Milestone name and deliverable description
2. Target completion date
3. Dependencies (which milestones must complete first?)
4. Owner or responsible role
5. Early warning indicator (how to detect if milestone is slipping)
6. Buffer time recommendation

Present as a timeline view, ordered chronologically. Identify the critical path (the longest sequence of dependent milestones that determines the minimum project duration).


PROMPT 3 - RESOURCE ALLOCATION ADVISOR
---------------------------------------
Help me assign resources to the following sub-goals for my goal:

For each sub-goal, recommend:
1. Personnel assignment (who should work on this and why)
2. Time allocation (estimated hours per week)
3. Budget allocation (if applicable)
4. Tools or platforms to use
5. Skills gaps (what's missing and how to address it)

Generate a resource allocation matrix table. Flag any over-allocated team members or budget conflicts. Suggest rebalancing options if resources are constrained.

PROMPT 5 - OBSTACLE AND CONTINGENCY PLANNER
--------------------------------------------
Help me prepare for obstacles that could derail my goal:

Goal: [YOUR GOAL]
Sub-Goals and Milestones: [LIST THEM or reference previous conversation]
Known Risks: [ANY RISKS YOU ALREADY ANTICIPATE]
Risk Tolerance: [LOW - can't afford delays / MEDIUM - some flexibility / HIGH - exploratory goal]

For each sub-goal, identify:
1. Top 3 potential obstacles (with probability: low/medium/high)
2. Impact assessment (what happens if this obstacle materializes?)
3. Early warning signs (how will you detect this before it becomes critical?)
4. Mitigation strategy (how to prevent or reduce the obstacle)
5. Contingency plan (if mitigation fails, what is Plan B?)

Also provide:
- "Minimum Viable Goal" definition (reduced scope that still delivers core value)
- Decision criteria for when to escalate, pivot, descope, or pause
- Schedule buffer recommendations for critical path milestones
- A risk register template I can maintain throughout the project


PROMPT 6 - TEAM GOAL BREAKDOWN

Meeting Cadence: [CURRENT MEETING SCHEDULE]

Generate:
1. RACI matrix for each milestone (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
2. Recommended meeting structure (standups, reviews, retrospectives)
3. Communication plan (what to share, with whom, how often, via what channel)
4. Handoff protocols between team members or phases
5. Escalation path for blockers or conflicts
6. Onboarding checklist for new team members joining mid-project

Update Frequency: [HOW OFTEN - e.g., "daily," "weekly," "biweekly"]

Create:
1. KPI definitions for each sub-goal (2-3 leading indicators, 1-2 lagging indicators)
2. Scoring methodology (percentage complete, RAG status, velocity metrics)
3. Status report template (for weekly/biweekly updates)
4. Dashboard layout recommendation for my chosen tool
5. Automated reminder schedule for milestone deadlines
6. Health check questions to ask at each review (5-7 diagnostic questions)
7. Trend indicators (how to spot goals going off-track before it's too late)

Make the tracking system simple enough to maintain in under 15 minutes per week.


PROMPT 8 - ANNUAL GOAL SCALING
-------------------------------
Scale the goal breakdown methodology for annual (12-month) planning:

For each annual goal, provide:
1. Quarterly sub-goal breakdown (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
2. Key milestones per quarter (2-3 per goal per quarter)
3. Resource allocation across quarters (front-loaded, even, back-loaded)
4. Inter-goal dependencies (how do these goals support or compete with each other?)
5. Quarterly review criteria (what should be true by end of each quarter?)
6. Annual success metrics and how to measure them

Also provide:
- Portfolio view: How to manage multiple goals simultaneously without overload
- Prioritization framework: When goals compete for resources, how to decide
- Year-end retrospective template: What to evaluate and how to feed into next year's planning


PROMPT 9 - DAILY PLAN INTEGRATION
----------------------------------

Goal: [YOUR GOAL]
Current Active Milestones: [MILESTONES DUE IN THE NEXT 2-4 WEEKS]
Available Hours Per Week: [HOURS YOU CAN DEDICATE TO THIS GOAL]
Other Commitments: [OTHER MAJOR PRIORITIES COMPETING FOR YOUR TIME]
Planning Tool: [WHERE YOU PLAN YOUR DAYS - e.g., "Google Calendar," "Todoist," "paper planner"]

Generate:
1. Weekly sprint plan template (what to plan each Monday)
2. Daily task breakdown from active milestones (sized to 30-min to 2-hour blocks)
3. Time-blocking recommendations for my available hours
4. Priority decision framework (when two milestone tasks compete, how to choose)
5. End-of-day review checklist (3-5 questions to close each day)
6. End-of-week review checklist (5-7 questions to close each week)
7. "Catch-up" protocol for when I fall behind on milestone tasks

Make this practical for someone who has 60 seconds to plan their day and 10 minutes to plan their week.
