# Risk Assessment & Mitigation Planner - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview and Objectives

The Risk Assessment & Mitigation Planner provides a systematic framework for identifying, evaluating, and addressing risks in any project, initiative, or business decision. Using probability-impact scoring and structured mitigation strategies, this workflow helps you move from reactive firefighting to proactive risk management.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Identify potential risks across all project dimensions
- Assess each risk using probability and impact scoring
- Develop targeted mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
- Assign clear ownership and action items for each mitigation
- Establish ongoing monitoring and early warning indicators

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Comprehensive risk register with scored and prioritized risks
- Actionable mitigation plans for top risks
- Clear ownership and accountability for risk management
- Early warning system for emerging risks
- Documented risk tolerance and decision criteria

**W.E.D.G.E Framework Integration:**
- **Workflow**: Systematizes risk identification and mitigation planning
- **Education**: Teaches structured risk assessment methodologies
- **Data**: Ensures risk data is documented without exposing sensitive details
- **Guidance**: Provides clear scoring criteria and decision frameworks
- **Empowerment**: Enables proactive risk management at any scale

## Prerequisites

- A specific project, plan, or initiative to assess
- Access to an AI assistant for brainstorming risks
- Spreadsheet tool for risk register (Google Sheets, Excel, etc.)
- 60-120 minutes for initial assessment
- Input from key stakeholders (if team project)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Risks (15-20 minutes)

   - [ ] Brainstorm risks across categories: technical, schedule, budget, resource, external
   - [ ] Use AI to generate additional risks you may not have considered
   - [ ] Review similar past projects for historical risk patterns
   - [ ] Consult team members for their risk perspectives
   - [ ] Document each risk with a clear description and potential trigger

**Output:** Completed step 1 deliverables

---

### Step 2: Assess Probability and Impact (15-20 minutes)

   - [ ] Score each risk on probability (1-5 scale: rare to almost certain)
   - [ ] Score each risk on impact (1-5 scale: negligible to catastrophic)
   - [ ] Calculate risk score (probability x impact)
   - [ ] Plot risks on a probability-impact matrix
   - [ ] Identify risks above your threshold for mitigation

**Output:** Completed step 2 deliverables

---

### Step 3: Develop Mitigation Strategies (15-20 minutes)

   - [ ] For each high-priority risk, choose strategy: avoid, reduce, transfer, accept
   - [ ] Define specific actions to implement the chosen strategy
   - [ ] Estimate cost and effort for each mitigation action
   - [ ] Identify residual risk after mitigation is applied
   - [ ] Prioritize mitigations by risk reduction per effort spent

**Output:** Completed step 3 deliverables

---

### Step 4: Assign Ownership and Timeline (10-15 minutes)

   - [ ] Assign a single owner for each risk and its mitigation
   - [ ] Set deadlines for mitigation implementation
   - [ ] Define escalation paths for risks that materialize
   - [ ] Establish review checkpoints for ongoing monitoring
   - [ ] Document acceptance criteria for when a risk is considered managed

**Output:** Completed step 4 deliverables

---

### Step 5: Monitor and Update (Ongoing (10-15 min/week))

   - [ ] Review risk register weekly or at each project milestone
   - [ ] Update probability/impact scores based on new information
   - [ ] Add newly identified risks to the register
   - [ ] Close risks that are no longer relevant
   - [ ] Report risk status to stakeholders at agreed intervals

**Output:** Completed step 5 deliverables

## Best Practices

1. **Include diverse perspectives when brainstorming risks — blind spots are dangerous**
2. **Be honest about probability scores — optimism bias is the #1 risk assessment error**
3. **Focus mitigation effort on high-probability, high-impact risks first**
4. **Document your risk tolerance upfront so decision-making is faster**
5. **Review risks at every project milestone, not just at the start**
6. **Keep the risk register visible and accessible to all stakeholders**
7. **Use AI to stress-test your mitigation strategies with worst-case scenarios**
8. **Track risk metrics over time to improve future assessments**
9. **Celebrate when mitigation plans work — it reinforces the practice**
10. **Accept that some risks can't be mitigated — have contingency plans for those**

## Common Pitfalls

1. **"Only identifying obvious risks"**: Use structured categories and AI brainstorming to uncover hidden risks
   - *Solution:* Use structured categories and AI brainstorming to uncover hidden risks
2. **"Optimism bias in scoring"**: Base scores on evidence and history, not hope — calibrate with past projects
   - *Solution:* Base scores on evidence and history, not hope — calibrate with past projects
3. **"Too many high-priority risks"**: If everything is critical, re-calibrate your scoring scale
   - *Solution:* If everything is critical, re-calibrate your scoring scale
4. **"Mitigation without ownership"**: Every mitigation needs a single named owner — 'the team' is not an owner
   - *Solution:* Every mitigation needs a single named owner — 'the team' is not an owner
5. **"Set and forget"**: Risk registers that aren't updated become useless — schedule regular reviews
   - *Solution:* Risk registers that aren't updated become useless — schedule regular reviews
6. **"Analysis paralysis"**: Don't spend more time assessing risks than addressing them — act on what you know
   - *Solution:* Don't spend more time assessing risks than addressing them — act on what you know
7. **"Ignoring positive risks (opportunities)"**: Risk assessment can also identify upside opportunities to pursue
   - *Solution:* Risk assessment can also identify upside opportunities to pursue
8. **"No contingency for accepted risks"**: Even accepted risks need a 'what if' plan in case they materialize
   - *Solution:* Even accepted risks need a 'what if' plan in case they materialize

## Time Estimates

- **Initial Setup:** 60-120 minutes for full assessment
- **Per Use:** 30-45 minutes for updates
- **Maintenance:** 15 minutes weekly monitoring
