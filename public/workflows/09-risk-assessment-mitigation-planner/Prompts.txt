RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION PLANNER - PROMPT VARIATIONS
========================================================

PROMPT 1 - RISK IDENTIFIER
--------------------------
Assess risks in this plan:

[DESCRIBE YOUR PROJECT OR PLAN]

Identify risks across these categories:
- Technical risks
- Schedule risks
- Budget risks
- Resource risks
- External/market risks
- Compliance/legal risks

For each risk, provide: Description, potential trigger, early warning signs.


PROMPT 2 - RISK SCORER
----------------------
Score these risks on Likelihood (1-5) and Impact (1-5):

[LIST YOUR IDENTIFIED RISKS]

For each risk provide:
- Likelihood score with justification
- Impact score with justification
- Combined risk score (L × I)
- Priority ranking
- Recommended response: Avoid, Reduce, Transfer, or Accept


PROMPT 3 - MITIGATION GENERATOR
-------------------------------
Generate mitigation strategies for this risk:

Risk: [DESCRIBE THE RISK]
Likelihood: [1-5]
Impact: [1-5]
Current controls: [ANY EXISTING MITIGATIONS]

Provide 3 mitigation options:
- Option A: Avoid the risk entirely
- Option B: Reduce the probability or impact
- Option C: Transfer the risk

For each: Actions, cost estimate, residual risk after mitigation.


PROMPT 4 - RISK PLANNER TABLE
-----------------------------
Build a complete risk planner table for this project:

[DESCRIBE YOUR PROJECT]

Create a table with columns:
- Risk ID | Description | Category | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status | Review Date

Populate with 8-10 relevant risks.


PROMPT 5 - RISK PRIORITIZER
---------------------------
Prioritize these risks and create an action plan:

[LIST YOUR SCORED RISKS WITH SCORES]

Group into:
- Critical (score 15-25): Immediate action required
- High (score 10-14): Action plan within 1 week
- Medium (score 5-9): Monitor and plan
- Low (score 1-4): Accept and monitor

For Critical and High risks, provide specific next steps.


PROMPT 6 - TEAM RISK WORKSHOP
-----------------------------
Design a team risk assessment workshop:

Project: [DESCRIBE]
Team size: [NUMBER]
Time available: [MINUTES]
Team familiarity with risk assessment: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]

Provide:
- Agenda with time allocations
- Facilitation instructions
- Risk brainstorming exercises
- Scoring methodology to use
- Output templates


PROMPT 7 - RISK REGISTER UPDATER
--------------------------------
Update my risk register with this new information:

Current risk register: [PASTE OR DESCRIBE]
New developments: [WHAT HAS CHANGED]
Date of last review: [DATE]

Identify:
- Risks that need score updates
- New risks to add
- Risks to close
- Mitigation status updates


PROMPT 8 - WORST CASE SIMULATOR
-------------------------------
Simulate worst-case scenarios for my project:

Project: [DESCRIBE]
Top risks: [LIST YOUR TOP 3-5 RISKS]

For each risk, simulate:
- What happens if this risk materializes fully
- Cascade effects on other project areas
- Recovery timeline estimate
- Emergency response actions
- Cost of impact vs. cost of prevention


PROMPT 9 - RISK-DECISION INTEGRATOR
-----------------------------------
Integrate risk assessment into this decision:

Decision: [DESCRIBE THE DECISION]
Options: [LIST OPTIONS BEING CONSIDERED]

For each option, assess:
- Top 3 risks introduced by this option
- Risk scores for each
- Net risk comparison across options
- Risk-adjusted recommendation


PROMPT 10 - LONG-TERM RISK TRACKER
----------------------------------
Create a long-term risk tracking system for my project:

Project duration: [MONTHS/YEARS]
Review frequency: [WEEKLY/MONTHLY/QUARTERLY]
Team size: [NUMBER]

Design:
- Risk register template
- Review meeting agenda
- Trend tracking dashboard
- Escalation criteria
- Reporting format for stakeholders

USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

PRIVACY PROTECTION:
When using these prompts, NEVER include:
- Actual confidential business information
- Real names, email addresses, or contact details
- Proprietary data, trade secrets, or internal metrics
- Client or customer identifying information
- Financial details (exact revenues, salaries, etc.)

Use placeholders:
- "[CLIENT_NAME]", "[COMPANY]" instead of real names
- "[AMOUNT]", "[METRIC]" for sensitive numbers
- Generic descriptions of situations rather than specifics

AI TOOL COMPATIBILITY:
These prompts work with all major AI assistants:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- Use with privacy-respecting settings (opt-out of training)

PROMPT CHAINING:
For best results, use prompts in sequence:
1. Start with Prompt 1 for initial setup
2. Use Prompts 2-5 for core workflow steps
3. Apply Prompts 6-8 for advanced applications
4. Use Prompts 9-10 for optimization and scaling

ITERATION:
If outputs aren't specific enough:
- "Make this specific to [your industry/context]"
- "Provide actual examples for [specific scenario]"
- "Add more detail to [specific section]"

SAVING OUTPUTS:
Keep all AI-generated outputs:
- Store in organized folders by date and topic
- Version control your working documents
- Share with team via secure channels only

VERIFICATION:
Always independently verify:
- Facts, figures, and claims in AI outputs
- Recommendations against your specific context
- Compliance with your organization's policies
