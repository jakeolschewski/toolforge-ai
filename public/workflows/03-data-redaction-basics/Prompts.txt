DATA REDACTION BASICS - PROMPT VARIATIONS
==========================================

PROMPT 1 - DATA REDACTION BASICS TUTORIAL
------------------------------------------
Teach me the basics of data redaction for privacy protection. Cover the following with clear examples:

1. What data redaction is and why it matters
2. Common types of sensitive data (PII, financial, health)
3. How to redact emails: replacing "john.doe@company.com" with [EMAIL]
4. How to redact names in documents: replacing "Jane Smith" with [NAME]
5. How to redact phone numbers, addresses, and ID numbers
6. Best practices for redacting in different formats (text, spreadsheets, PDFs)

Provide before/after examples for each data type. Keep examples generic and use only fictional data. Format as a beginner-friendly guide I can reference daily.


PROMPT 2 - SAMPLE TEXT REDACTION PRACTICE
-----------------------------------------
Redact the following sample text by replacing all sensitive data with appropriate tokens. Use these replacement conventions:
- Names → [NAME]
- Email addresses → [EMAIL]
- Phone numbers → [PHONE]
- Physical addresses → [ADDRESS]
- Dates of birth → [DOB]
- Account/ID numbers → [ACCOUNT_ID]
- Financial amounts → [AMOUNT]

Sample text to redact:
[PASTE YOUR NON-SENSITIVE SAMPLE TEXT HERE]

After redacting, provide:
1. The fully redacted version
2. A summary table listing each redaction made (original type, token used, count)
3. Any indirect identifiers that could still allow re-identification
4. Suggestions for improving the redaction


PROMPT 3 - REDACTION CHECKLIST GENERATOR
-----------------------------------------
Create a comprehensive redaction checklist for this specific data type:

Data type: [SPECIFY - e.g., customer support emails, medical intake forms, financial reports, HR records, survey responses, etc.]

For this data type, generate:
1. Complete list of PII fields likely present
2. Priority ranking (critical, high, medium, low risk)
3. Recommended redaction token for each field
4. Regex patterns for automated detection (where applicable)
5. Common locations where this data hides (headers, footers, metadata, embedded objects)
6. Special considerations for this data type
7. Verification steps specific to this data type
8. A copy-paste-ready checklist I can use for every document of this type

Format as a printable checklist with checkboxes.


PROMPT 4 - AUTOMATED REDACTION TOOLS OVERVIEW
----------------------------------------------
Explain the available tools for automated data redaction. I need a vendor-neutral comparison covering:

My situation:
- Team size: [Solo, 2-5, 5-20, 20+]

- Budget: [$0 (free only), $10-50/month, $50-200/month, enterprise]
- Document types: [Text files, PDFs, spreadsheets, images, databases, all]
- Compliance requirements: [None, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, CCPA, etc.]

Compare tools across these categories:
1. Open-source / free tools (Microsoft Presidio, SpaCy NER, regex scripts)
2. Cloud-based services (AWS Comprehend, Google DLP, Azure PII Detection)
3. Desktop applications (Adobe Acrobat Pro, dedicated redaction software)
4. No-code / low-code options (built-in features in Google Docs, Word, etc.)

For each tool provide:
- Best suited for (use case)
- PII types it can detect
- Ease of setup (1-10)
- Accuracy/reliability
- Cost
- Pros and cons
- Integration capabilities

Conclude with your recommendation for my situation.


PROMPT 5 - DATASET REDACTION SIMULATION
----------------------------------------
Simulate the process of redacting a dataset for privacy compliance. Walk me through a complete end-to-end redaction exercise:

Dataset description: [DESCRIBE YOUR DATASET TYPE - e.g., customer database export, survey results, transaction log, employee directory, etc.]
Number of records: [APPROXIMATE COUNT]
Columns/fields: [LIST THE FIELD NAMES]

For this simulation:
1. Classify each field as: Direct identifier, Quasi-identifier, Sensitive attribute, or Non-sensitive
2. Recommend redaction method for each field:
   - Full removal
   - Token replacement (e.g., [NAME])
   - Generalization (e.g., exact age → age range)
   - Pseudonymization (consistent fake replacement)
   - K-anonymity grouping
3. Create a sample of 5 synthetic records showing before and after redaction
4. Identify re-identification risks even after redaction
5. Provide a SQL or Python script template for batch redaction
6. Recommend verification steps to confirm dataset is safe to share

Use only synthetic/fictional data in all examples.


PROMPT 6 - CUSTOM REDACTION RULES BUILDER
------------------------------------------
Help me build a set of custom redaction rules for removing specific information from my documents:

Information to redact: [SPECIFY - e.g., employee names, patient IDs, client company names, internal project codes, salary figures, etc.]

Document context: [DESCRIBE - e.g., meeting notes, customer reports, legal contracts, email exports, etc.]

For each type of information, create:
1. Detection rule (how to find it):
   - Keyword patterns
   - Regex expressions
   - Contextual clues (e.g., "Dear [first name]", "Patient: [name]")
2. Replacement rule (what to substitute):
   - Standard token
   - Numbered token (for multi-instance tracking)
   - Contextual replacement (preserving readability)
3. Edge cases to watch for:
   - Variations in format
   - Partial matches
   - Data in unusual locations (footers, watermarks, comments)
4. Validation rule (how to confirm it worked):
   - Post-redaction search patterns
   - Negative test (confirm no real data remains)

Format as a rules reference card I can use during redaction work.


PROMPT 7 - REDACTION EFFECTIVENESS AUDIT
-----------------------------------------
Audit the effectiveness of redaction applied to this document or dataset:

[PASTE YOUR ALREADY-REDACTED SAMPLE HERE]

Analyze the redacted content for:
1. Completeness: Are all PII types properly redacted?
2. Consistency: Are the same tokens used throughout?
3. Indirect identifiers: Can any combination of remaining data re-identify individuals?
4. Context leakage: Does surrounding text reveal what was redacted?
5. Metadata exposure: Are there references to file properties, author names, or timestamps that could identify someone?
6. Token quality: Are replacement tokens clear and standardized?
7. Readability: Is the document still usable after redaction?

Provide:
- Risk score (1-10, where 10 is highest risk of re-identification)
- List of specific issues found
- Recommended fixes for each issue
- An improved redacted version (if issues found)
- Pass/fail assessment with justification


PROMPT 8 - AI WORKFLOW REDACTION INTEGRATION
---------------------------------------------

My AI workflow:
- AI tools used: [LIST - e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, etc.]
- Data I send to AI: [DESCRIBE - e.g., customer emails, code with comments, meeting transcripts, etc.]
- Data AI generates: [DESCRIBE - e.g., summaries, reports, draft responses, analysis, etc.]
- Frequency: [Daily, weekly, per-project]
- Team size: [Solo, small team, department]

Create a redaction integration plan covering:

3. Post-output scanning process (what to check in AI responses)
4. Workflow diagram showing where redaction steps occur
5. Quick-reference card for daily use
6. Training guide for team members
7. Exception handling (when redaction is not possible or practical)
8. Metrics to track redaction compliance in AI workflows

Make this actionable and easy to follow for someone new to redaction.


PROMPT 9 - COMMON REDACTION MISTAKES AND FIXES
------------------------------------------------
Identify common mistakes people make when redacting data, and provide fixes for each:

Cover these categories:
1. Document redaction mistakes (PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets)
2. AI input/output mistakes (sending PII to AI tools, not reviewing outputs)
3. Technical mistakes (visual-only redaction, metadata leaks, encoding issues)
4. Process mistakes (no verification, inconsistent methods, no audit trail)
5. Team/collaboration mistakes (shared drives with unredacted originals, no training)

For each mistake:
- Describe the mistake clearly
- Explain why it's dangerous (what could go wrong)
- Provide a real-world example scenario (using fictional data)
