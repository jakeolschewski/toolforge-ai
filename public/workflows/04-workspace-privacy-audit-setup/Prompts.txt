WORKSPACE PRIVACY AUDIT & SETUP - PROMPT VARIATIONS
=====================================================

PROMPT 1 - COMPREHENSIVE WORKSPACE PRIVACY AUDIT
-------------------------------------------------
Audit my AI workspace privacy. Here are the tools and services I currently use:

Tools: [LIST YOUR TOOLS - e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Notion, Slack, Zapier, Google Drive, VS Code with Copilot, etc.]

For each tool, analyze and report:
1. Data collection practices (what data does the tool collect?)
2. Training data usage (does it use my inputs for model training?)
3. Data retention period (how long is my data stored?)
4. Third-party data sharing (who else gets access to my data?)
5. Opt-out availability (can I opt out of data collection/training?)
6. Encryption status (data at rest and in transit)
7. Privacy risk score (1-10, where 10 is highest risk)
8. Recommended actions to reduce risk

Format the results as a table I can copy to a spreadsheet, followed by a prioritized list of the top 5 actions I should take immediately.

PROMPT 4 - WORKFLOW RISK IDENTIFICATION
----------------------------------------
Identify privacy risks in the following workflow:

Workflow description:
[DESCRIBE YOUR WORKFLOW - e.g., "I copy customer support emails into ChatGPT to draft responses, then paste the responses into our CRM. I also use Zapier to automatically send new support tickets to a Slack channel for triage."]

For this workflow, analyze:
1. Every point where data is exposed to a third party
2. Data types at risk (PII, credentials, business-sensitive, etc.)
3. Unencrypted or weakly protected data transfers
4. Potential for data leakage or unauthorized retention
5. Compliance risks (if applicable regulations mentioned)
6. Risk severity for each finding (Critical / High / Medium / Low)

Provide:
- A numbered list of all risks found
- A risk matrix (likelihood vs. impact)
- Specific mitigation steps for each risk
- An alternative workflow design that reduces risk
- A "quick wins" section for changes implementable in under 30 minutes

==============================================================================
USAGE GUIDELINES
==============================================================================

PRIVACY PROTECTION:
When using these prompts, NEVER include:
- Actual customer or user data (names, emails, account numbers)
- Real API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Specific internal system URLs or IP addresses
- Confidential business processes or trade secrets
- Employee names (use roles instead)
- Specific vendor contract details

Use placeholders:
- "Tool A", "Tool B" instead of real tool names if discussing sensitive setups
- "[CUSTOMER_DATA]" instead of actual customer information
- Generic workflow descriptions rather than proprietary processes
- "Team Member 1", "Developer A" instead of real names

AI TOOL COMPATIBILITY:
These prompts work with all major AI assistants:
- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity
- Use with privacy-respecting settings (opt-out of training where possible)
- Avoid pasting real sensitive data even when testing privacy tools

PROMPT CHAINING:
Recommended sequence for complete privacy audit and setup:
1. Start with Prompt 1 (Comprehensive Audit) for baseline assessment
2. Then Prompt 4 (Risk Identification) for specific workflows
3. Follow with Prompt 3 (Checklist Generator) for ongoing process
4. Use Prompt 5 (VPN and Encryption) for technical controls
5. Implement Prompt 7 (Secure Configuration) for setup hardening
6. Prepare with Prompt 6 (Breach Response) for incident readiness
7. Scale with Prompt 10 (Team Guidelines) if working with others
8. Maintain with Prompt 9 (Monthly Audit Integration) for ongoing health

ITERATION:
If outputs are not specific enough:
- "Make this specific to [your operating system / tool / industry]"
- "Provide exact navigation paths for [specific tool] settings"
- "Add regulatory-specific requirements for [GDPR / HIPAA / etc.]"
- "Include automation scripts for checks in steps 3-5"

SAVING OUTPUTS:
Keep all AI-generated audit results:
- Store in encrypted storage (not plain text on desktop)
- Version control your privacy policies (track changes over time)
- Share audit results via secure channels only
- Archive previous audits for trend analysis

VERIFICATION:
Always independently verify:
- Privacy policy details (check official tool documentation)
- Regulatory requirements (consult legal or compliance professionals)
- Technical controls (test them; do not assume they work)
- VPN and encryption claims (verify with independent testing tools)
