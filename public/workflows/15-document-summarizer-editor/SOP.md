# Document Summarizer & Editor - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview and Objectives

The Document Summarizer & Editor provides a systematic approach to efficiently summarizing long documents and editing them for clarity, conciseness, and impact. Using AI-assisted extraction and restructuring, this workflow reduces document processing time by 60-80% while maintaining accuracy and quality.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Generate targeted summaries (executive, key points, action items)
- Edit documents for improved clarity and conciseness
- Verify summary accuracy against source materials
- Restructure documents for better flow and readability
- Maintain version control across editing iterations

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 60-80% reduction in document processing time
- Professional-quality summaries at multiple length levels
- Improved document clarity and readability scores
- Consistent editing standards across all documents
- Version-controlled editing trail for accountability

**W.E.D.G.E Framework Integration:**
- **Workflow**: Systematizes document summarization and editing
- **Education**: Teaches effective summarization and editing techniques
- **Data**: Protects document contents through proper redaction before AI processing
- **Guidance**: Provides clear frameworks for summary types and editing priorities
- **Empowerment**: Enables efficient document processing with professional results

## Prerequisites

- Document(s) to summarize or edit
- Access to an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Word processor or text editor
- Clear understanding of the target audience and purpose
- 10-30 minutes per document depending on length

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare Document for Processing (3-5 minutes)

   - [ ] Read the document once to understand overall structure and content
   - [ ] Identify the target output (summary type, editing goals)
   - [ ] Redact any sensitive information before AI processing
   - [ ] Note the target audience and their knowledge level
   - [ ] Determine desired output length and format

**Output:** Completed step 1 deliverables

---

### Step 2: Generate Summary (5-10 minutes)

   - [ ] Use AI to create initial summary at target length
   - [ ] Request different summary types as needed (executive, key points, action items)
   - [ ] Verify key points are captured accurately
   - [ ] Check that no important information is missing
   - [ ] Iterate on the summary with specific revision requests

**Output:** Completed step 2 deliverables

---

### Step 3: Edit for Clarity (5-10 minutes)

   - [ ] Review for jargon or complex language that could be simplified
   - [ ] Check sentence structure for readability
   - [ ] Ensure logical flow between sections and paragraphs
   - [ ] Remove redundant information and filler words
   - [ ] Verify consistent terminology throughout

**Output:** Completed step 3 deliverables

---

### Step 4: Verify Accuracy (3-5 minutes)

   - [ ] Cross-check key facts and figures against the original
   - [ ] Verify that summary doesn't misrepresent the source
   - [ ] Check for any AI-introduced errors or hallucinations
   - [ ] Confirm all quoted material is accurately represented
   - [ ] Ensure context is preserved — no misleading omissions

**Output:** Completed step 4 deliverables

---

### Step 5: Export and Version Control (2-3 minutes)

   - [ ] Save the final version with clear naming convention
   - [ ] Document what changes were made from the original
   - [ ] Archive the original document for reference
   - [ ] Share with stakeholders through appropriate channels
   - [ ] Note any follow-up actions identified during processing

**Output:** Completed step 5 deliverables

## Best Practices

1. **Always read the source document before asking AI to summarize it**
2. **Specify the exact summary length and format you need upfront**
3. **Verify every fact, figure, and quote against the original**
4. **Edit in multiple passes: structure first, then clarity, then polish**
5. **Keep the original document as a reference — never delete it**
6. **Use consistent naming conventions for document versions**
7. **Match the summary style to the audience (executive vs. technical)**
8. **Don't over-summarize — some detail is necessary for accuracy**
9. **Build a style guide for recurring document types**
10. **Track time savings to demonstrate the workflow's value**

## Common Pitfalls

1. **"Trusting AI summaries blindly"**: AI can miss nuance and introduce errors — always verify against the source
   - *Solution:* AI can miss nuance and introduce errors — always verify against the source
2. **"Over-summarizing"**: Losing critical detail in the pursuit of brevity — know when detail matters
   - *Solution:* Losing critical detail in the pursuit of brevity — know when detail matters
3. **"Editing without clear goals"**: Define what 'better' means before you start editing — clarity? brevity? tone?
   - *Solution:* Define what 'better' means before you start editing — clarity? brevity? tone?
4. **"Skipping the accuracy check"**: A concise but inaccurate summary is worse than the original — verify facts
   - *Solution:* A concise but inaccurate summary is worse than the original — verify facts
5. **"Not redacting before AI input"**: Remove sensitive content before pasting into AI tools
   - *Solution:* Remove sensitive content before pasting into AI tools
6. **"Losing the original"**: Always keep the source document — you may need to re-check or re-summarize
   - *Solution:* Always keep the source document — you may need to re-check or re-summarize
7. **"One-pass editing"**: Good editing requires multiple passes — structure, clarity, then polish
   - *Solution:* Good editing requires multiple passes — structure, clarity, then polish
8. **"Ignoring audience"**: A summary for executives differs dramatically from one for technical teams
   - *Solution:* A summary for executives differs dramatically from one for technical teams

## Time Estimates

- **Initial Setup:** 30 minutes (first document with template setup)
- **Per Use:** 10-30 minutes per document
- **Maintenance:** 15 minutes monthly style guide review
