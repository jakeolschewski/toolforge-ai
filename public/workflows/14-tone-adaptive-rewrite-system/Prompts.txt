TONE-ADAPTIVE REWRITE SYSTEM - PROMPT VARIATIONS
===================================================

PROMPT 1 - TONE REWRITE (CORE)
-------------------------------
Rewrite the following text in a [TARGET TONE] tone. Preserve the original meaning, all factual claims, and key messages exactly. Do not add new information or remove existing points.

Original text:
[PASTE ORIGINAL TEXT HERE]

Target tone: [e.g., formal, casual, professional, empathetic, authoritative, conversational]
Target audience: [e.g., C-suite executives, college students, general public, technical engineers]
Constraints:
- Word count: [APPROXIMATE TARGET, e.g., "similar to original" or "under 200 words"]
- Preserve these terms exactly: [LIST ANY TERMS THAT MUST NOT CHANGE]
- Format: [Maintain original structure / Restructure as needed]

After the rewrite, provide a brief note (2-3 sentences) explaining the specific tone choices you made and why.


PROMPT 2 - AUDIENCE-ADAPTIVE REWRITE
-------------------------------------
Adapt the tone of the following text specifically for [TARGET AUDIENCE]. Consider their:
- Professional background and expertise level
- Communication preferences and expectations
- Cultural context and formality norms
- Relationship to the writer (peer, superior, customer, stranger)

Original text:
[PASTE ORIGINAL TEXT HERE]

Target audience: [DESCRIBE IN DETAIL - e.g., "Non-technical small business owners in the US, ages 35-55, who are evaluating software for the first time"]

Specific instructions:
- Replace jargon with: [accessible language / industry-standard terms / simplified explanations]
- Reading level target: [e.g., 8th grade, college-level, graduate-level]
- Formality level: [1-10 scale, where 1 = text message casual, 10 = legal document formal]

Provide the rewrite followed by a "Translation Notes" section explaining what you changed and why for this audience.


PROMPT 3 - ITERATIVE REFINEMENT
--------------------------------
Here is Version [N] of a tone rewrite. I need Version [N+1] that is more [ADJECTIVE/QUALITY].

Current version (Version [N]):
[PASTE CURRENT VERSION HERE]

Target adjustment: Make it more [e.g., empathetic, concise, authoritative, warm, direct, nuanced]

Specific areas to improve:
1. [e.g., "The opening paragraph feels too stiff"]
2. [e.g., "Paragraph 3 lost the original meaning about delivery timelines"]
3. [e.g., "The closing needs to be more action-oriented"]

Constraints:
- Do NOT change: [LIST SECTIONS OR PHRASES TO KEEP AS-IS]
- Maintain overall word count within [+/- X%] of current version
- Keep the same structural format

Provide the updated version and a changelog listing every sentence you modified with a brief reason for each change.


PROMPT 4 - SIDE-BY-SIDE TONE COMPARISON
-----------------------------------------
I have [NUMBER] versions of the same text written in different tones. Analyze them side-by-side and provide a structured comparison.

Version A - [TONE LABEL, e.g., "Formal"]:
[PASTE VERSION A]

Version B - [TONE LABEL, e.g., "Conversational"]:
[PASTE VERSION B]

Version C - [TONE LABEL, e.g., "Empathetic"] (optional):
[PASTE VERSION C]

Compare these versions across the following dimensions:
1. Tone accuracy: How well does each achieve its intended tone? (1-10)
2. Meaning preservation: Does each version retain the original message? (1-10)
3. Readability: How clear and easy to follow is each version? (1-10)
4. Audience fit: How appropriate is each for its intended audience? (1-10)
5. Natural language: Does each sound like a human wrote it? (1-10)
6. Persuasiveness: Which is most compelling? (rank order)

Provide:
- A comparison table with scores
- Specific examples of what each version does well and poorly
- A recommendation for which version to use (or how to combine the best elements)


PROMPT 5 - TONE BLENDING
--------------------------
Rewrite the following text using a blended tone that combines [TONE 1] and [TONE 2]. The blend should be approximately [X]% [TONE 1] and [Y]% [TONE 2].

Original text:
[PASTE ORIGINAL TEXT HERE]

Tone blend:
- Primary tone: [TONE 1, e.g., "professional"] - [X]%
- Secondary tone: [TONE 2, e.g., "friendly"] - [Y]%

Context for this blend: [e.g., "A company email that needs to be taken seriously but also feel approachable and human"]

Examples of the desired blended tone (for reference):
- [PROVIDE 1-2 EXAMPLE SENTENCES IN YOUR TARGET BLEND]

Preserve all original meaning and facts. After the rewrite, explain how you balanced the two tones throughout the text and identify any sentences where the blend was particularly challenging.


PROMPT 6 - TEAM REWRITE SYSTEM SETUP
--------------------------------------
Help me create a team tone guide and rewrite system for [NUMBER] writers who need to produce content in a consistent [TARGET TONE] voice.

Context:

- Content types: [e.g., blog posts, emails, reports, social media]
- Brand/organization: [DESCRIBE BRIEFLY - or use placeholder if sensitive]
- Current challenge: [e.g., "Inconsistent tone across writers," "Transitioning from formal to conversational"]

Generate a comprehensive team tone guide that includes:

1. **Tone Definition:**
   - 3-sentence description of the target tone
   - 5 "this, not that" examples (correct tone vs. incorrect tone)
   - Vocabulary preferences (words to use, words to avoid)

2. **Rewrite Checklist (for each team member to follow):**
   - Step-by-step process for tone adaptation
   - Self-review questions before submitting

3. **Calibration Exercises:**
   - 3 sample paragraphs for team members to rewrite
   - Model answers showing the correct tone
   - Common mistakes and how to fix them

4. **Quality Control Process:**
   - Peer review guidelines
   - Tone consistency scoring rubric
   - Escalation process for uncertain cases

Format this as a ready-to-distribute team document.


PROMPT 7 - SHORTEN WHILE ADAPTING TONE
---------------------------------------
Rewrite the following text to be significantly shorter while simultaneously adapting the tone to [TARGET TONE]. The shortened version should be approximately [TARGET LENGTH, e.g., "50% of original," "under 100 words," "3 sentences"].

Original text ([CURRENT WORD COUNT] words):
[PASTE ORIGINAL TEXT HERE]

Target tone: [e.g., formal, casual, direct, warm]
Target length: [SPECIFY - e.g., "Under 150 words," "Half the original length," "A single paragraph"]

Prioritize preserving:
1. [MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE/POINT]
2. [SECOND MOST IMPORTANT]
3. [THIRD MOST IMPORTANT]

May be cut or condensed:
- [DETAILS THAT CAN BE REMOVED]
- [EXAMPLES THAT ARE OPTIONAL]
- [CONTEXT THAT THE AUDIENCE ALREADY KNOWS]

Provide the shortened rewrite, followed by:
- A list of what was removed and why
- Confirmation that priority messages are preserved
- The final word count


PROMPT 8 - EXPAND WITH DETAIL IN TONE
---------------------------------------
Expand the following text with additional detail and depth while maintaining a consistent [TARGET TONE] throughout. The expanded version should be approximately [TARGET LENGTH, e.g., "twice the original," "500 words," "3 paragraphs"].

Original text ([CURRENT WORD COUNT] words):
[PASTE ORIGINAL TEXT HERE]

Target tone: [e.g., formal, conversational, academic, persuasive]
Target length: [SPECIFY]

Areas to expand:
1. [e.g., "Add supporting examples for the main argument"]
2. [e.g., "Elaborate on the process described in paragraph 2"]
3. [e.g., "Include transitional context between sections"]

Do NOT:
- Add factual claims not supported by or implied by the original
- Change the meaning or emphasis of existing points
- Introduce new arguments or positions not present in the original

Provide the expanded rewrite, followed by a summary of what was added and how you maintained tone consistency across the new material.


PROMPT 9 - CULTURAL SENSITIVITY CHECK
---------------------------------------
Review the following rewritten text for cultural sensitivity and appropriateness. The text has been adapted to a [TONE] tone for [TARGET AUDIENCE].

Text to review:
[PASTE REWRITTEN TEXT HERE]

Original tone: [ORIGINAL TONE]
Adapted tone: [NEW TONE]
Target audience: [DESCRIBE AUDIENCE, including cultural/regional context]
Distribution context: [e.g., "Internal company email to global team," "Public-facing website for US market," "Customer support response for EU clients"]

Evaluate for:
1. **Idioms and metaphors:** Are any culturally specific or potentially confusing?
2. **Assumptions:** Does the text assume shared cultural knowledge that the audience may not have?
3. **Formality norms:** Is the level of formality appropriate for the audience's cultural expectations?
4. **Humor:** Is any humor present? Is it appropriate and unlikely to offend?
5. **Inclusive language:** Is the text gender-neutral and inclusive where appropriate?
6. **Power dynamics:** Does the tone inadvertently convey condescension, superiority, or exclusion?
7. **Regional language:** Are there spelling, terminology, or date format differences to consider (US vs. UK English, etc.)?

Provide:
- A sensitivity score (1-10, where 10 = fully appropriate)
- Specific flagged items with explanations
- Suggested alternatives for any problematic language
- An overall assessment of cultural readiness


PROMPT 10 - BATCH REWRITE SET
-------------------------------
I need to rewrite a batch of [NUMBER] texts using the same tone parameters. Help me set up an efficient batch rewriting process and then rewrite each text.

Shared parameters for all texts:
- Target tone: [TONE]
- Target audience: [AUDIENCE]
- Constraints: [WORD COUNT, FORMAT, PRESERVED TERMS]
- Quality threshold: [e.g., "Tone accuracy 8/10+, meaning preservation 9/10+"]

Text 1 - [LABEL/TITLE]:
[PASTE TEXT 1]

Text 2 - [LABEL/TITLE]:
[PASTE TEXT 2]

Text 3 - [LABEL/TITLE]:
[PASTE TEXT 3]

[ADD MORE AS NEEDED]

For each text, provide:
1. The rewrite
2. A tone accuracy self-score (1-10)
3. A meaning preservation self-score (1-10)
4. One sentence noting the most significant change made

After all rewrites, provide:
- A consistency check: Do all rewrites sound like they came from the same voice?
- Any texts that were particularly challenging and why
- Recommendations for maintaining consistency across larger batches
