# Tone-Adaptive Rewrite System - Standard Operating Procedure

## Overview and Objectives

The Tone-Adaptive Rewrite System provides a structured methodology for transforming existing text into different tonal registers while preserving meaning, intent, and accuracy. This workflow enables individuals and teams to systematically adapt written content for diverse audiences, communication contexts, and brand voice requirements using AI-assisted rewriting with rigorous quality control.

**Primary Objectives:**
- Establish a repeatable process for tone identification and transformation
- Preserve original meaning and factual accuracy through every rewrite iteration
- Enable side-by-side comparison of tonal variations for informed selection
- Build reusable tone guides and style templates for consistent output
- Support team collaboration on multi-voice writing projects

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Consistently accurate tone transformations across formal, casual, technical, empathetic, and persuasive registers
- Documented tone guides that any team member can apply independently
- Reduced revision cycles through structured iterative improvement
- Cultural and contextual sensitivity embedded in every rewrite
- Exportable deliverables (versioned documents, tone reference sheets, final drafts)

**W.E.D.G.E Framework Integration:**
- **Workflow**: Systematizes the rewrite process from input through finalization
- **Education**: Teaches tone awareness, audience analysis, and iterative refinement
- **Data**: Protects original content through redaction and placeholder practices
- **Guidance**: Provides clear prompts, checklists, and comparison frameworks
- **Empowerment**: Enables self-service tone adaptation without specialized copywriting expertise

## Prerequisites

- Original text or document requiring tone adaptation
- Clear understanding of target audience and communication context
- Access to an AI writing assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or equivalent)
- Word processor or text editor for version tracking
- 30-45 minutes for a single rewrite cycle; 60-90 minutes for multi-tone comparison
- Familiarity with basic writing concepts (tone, register, audience)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Assess the Original Text (5-10 minutes)

Analyze the source material before any rewriting begins:

1. **Identify Current Tone:**
   - [ ] Read the full text and note the dominant tone (casual, formal, neutral, technical, emotional)
   - [ ] Highlight specific words, phrases, or structures that define the current tone
   - [ ] Note the reading level (simple, intermediate, advanced)
   - [ ] Identify the apparent target audience of the original
   - [ ] Flag any jargon, idioms, or culturally specific references

2. **Document Core Content:**
   - [ ] List the key messages and factual claims in the text
   - [ ] Identify the primary purpose (inform, persuade, instruct, entertain)
   - [ ] Note any data points, statistics, or quotes that must be preserved exactly
   - [ ] Record the word count and structural format (paragraphs, bullets, headings)

3. **Assess Rewrite Complexity:**
   - How different is the target tone from the original? (minor shift vs. complete overhaul)
   - Are there domain-specific terms that must remain unchanged?
   - Does the text contain sensitive content requiring redaction before rewriting?

**Output:** Annotated original text with tone markers, core message list, and complexity assessment

---

### Step 2: Define Target Tone and Audience (5-10 minutes)

Establish clear parameters for the rewrite:

1. **Specify Target Tone:**
   - [ ] Select primary tone: Formal / Casual / Professional / Friendly / Academic / Conversational / Authoritative / Empathetic / Persuasive / Technical
   - [ ] Define secondary tone qualities (e.g., "formal but approachable" or "technical yet accessible")
   - [ ] Provide 2-3 example sentences in the target tone for reference
   - [ ] Identify any tones to explicitly avoid (e.g., "not sarcastic," "not condescending")

2. **Define Target Audience:**
   - [ ] Demographics: Age range, professional background, education level
   - [ ] Relationship to writer: Colleague, customer, executive, general public
   - [ ] Context: Email, report, social media, presentation, policy document
   - [ ] Cultural considerations: Regional language norms, formality expectations

3. **Set Constraints:**
   - [ ] Maximum/minimum word count
   - [ ] Required terminology or phrases to preserve
   - [ ] Format requirements (maintain headings, bullet structure, etc.)
   - [ ] Brand voice guidelines (if applicable)

**Output:** Tone specification document with audience profile and constraints

---

### Step 3: Prepare Text for AI Rewriting (5-10 minutes)

Sanitize and structure the input for optimal AI processing:

1. **Apply Redaction:**
   - [ ] Replace real names with placeholders: "[CLIENT_NAME]," "[EMPLOYEE_NAME]"
   - [ ] Substitute sensitive data: "[REVENUE_FIGURE]," "[CONTRACT_TERMS]"
   - [ ] Remove or generalize proprietary information
   - [ ] Review Redaction-Guide.txt for comprehensive checklist

2. **Structure the Input:**
   - [ ] Break long documents into logical sections for section-by-section rewriting
   - [ ] Mark sections that should NOT be rewritten (legal disclaimers, quotes, data tables)
   - [ ] Number paragraphs for easy reference during comparison
   - [ ] Add inline notes for context the AI may need (e.g., "[This refers to Q3 results]")

3. **Create Rewrite Brief:**
   - [ ] Combine tone specification, audience profile, and constraints into a single prompt header
   - [ ] Include 1-2 "golden examples" of the desired tone for the AI to reference
   - [ ] Specify what "success" looks like for this rewrite

**Output:** Redacted, structured text with rewrite brief ready for AI input

---

### Step 4: Generate First Rewrite (Version 1) (5-10 minutes)

Execute the initial tone transformation:

1. **Submit to AI Assistant:**
   - [ ] Use Prompt 1 ("Rewrite [text] in [tone]") with full rewrite brief
   - [ ] Include the complete original text (or first section for long documents)
   - [ ] Request that the AI explain its tone choices alongside the rewrite

2. **Initial Quality Check:**
   - [ ] Read the rewrite aloud to hear the tone
   - [ ] Verify all key messages from Step 1 are preserved
   - [ ] Check that factual accuracy is maintained (no hallucinated details)
   - [ ] Confirm word count is within constraints
   - [ ] Flag any awkward phrasing or unnatural language

3. **Document Version 1:**
   - [ ] Save as "V1 - [Tone] - [Date]"
   - [ ] Note initial impressions: What works well? What needs adjustment?
   - [ ] Rate tone accuracy on a 1-10 scale
   - [ ] Rate meaning preservation on a 1-10 scale

**Output:** Version 1 rewrite with quality notes and ratings

---

### Step 5: Iterate and Refine (Version 2+) (10-15 minutes)

Improve the rewrite through targeted iteration:

1. **Identify Specific Improvements:**
   - [ ] List 3-5 specific areas where the tone could be stronger
   - [ ] Note any sentences where meaning shifted during rewrite
   - [ ] Identify transitions or connectors that feel off-tone
   - [ ] Check for consistency (does the tone waver between sections?)

2. **Submit Refinement Prompts:**
   - [ ] Use Prompt 3 ("Iterate rewrite: Version 2 more [adjective]") for targeted adjustments
   - [ ] Address one improvement area per iteration to track impact
   - [ ] Ask the AI to highlight what it changed between versions
   - [ ] Request alternative phrasings for problematic sentences

3. **Track Iteration Progress:**
   - [ ] Save each version with incrementing version numbers
   - [ ] Document what was changed and why
   - [ ] Rate each version on tone accuracy and meaning preservation
   - [ ] Stop iterating when both ratings reach 8/10 or above

4. **Apply Length Adjustments (if needed):**
   - [ ] Use Prompt 7 ("Shorten while adapting") if the rewrite is too long
   - [ ] Use Prompt 8 ("Expand for detail in tone") if more depth is needed
   - [ ] Verify that length changes do not sacrifice tone quality

**Output:** Version 2+ rewrites with iteration log showing progressive improvement

---

### Step 6: Generate Alternative Tone Versions (10-15 minutes)

Create comparison versions in different tones for evaluation:

1. **Select Comparison Tones:**
   - [ ] Choose 2-3 additional tones beyond the primary target
   - [ ] Include at least one tone that contrasts strongly with the target (for calibration)
   - [ ] Consider audience-specific variations (same tone, different audience)

2. **Generate Alternatives:**
   - [ ] Use Prompt 2 ("Adapt tone for [audience]") for audience-driven variations
   - [ ] Use Prompt 5 ("Blend tones: [tone1] + [tone2]") for hybrid approaches
   - [ ] Maintain the same source text for all versions to ensure fair comparison
   - [ ] Apply the same constraints (word count, preserved terms) to all versions

3. **Document All Versions:**
   - [ ] Label clearly: "Version A - Formal," "Version B - Conversational," etc.
   - [ ] Ensure all versions are saved in the same document or folder
   - [ ] Note the prompt used to generate each version

**Output:** 3-4 tone variations of the same source text, labeled and documented

---

### Step 7: Compare Versions Side-by-Side (5-10 minutes)

Evaluate all versions using structured comparison:

1. **Set Up Comparison View:**
   - [ ] Arrange versions in parallel columns (or sequential with clear labels)
   - [ ] Use Prompt 4 ("Compare tones side-by-side") to generate an AI analysis
   - [ ] Create a comparison matrix with criteria rows and version columns

2. **Evaluate Each Version Against Criteria:**
   - [ ] Tone accuracy (1-10): Does it sound like the intended tone?
   - [ ] Meaning preservation (1-10): Is the original message intact?
   - [ ] Readability (1-10): Is it clear and easy to follow?
   - [ ] Audience fit (1-10): Would the target audience respond well?
   - [ ] Natural language (1-10): Does it sound human-written?
   - [ ] Cultural sensitivity (1-10): Is it appropriate for all intended readers?

3. **Select Winner or Combine:**
   - [ ] Identify the strongest version overall
   - [ ] Note if certain sections work better in different versions
   - [ ] Consider creating a "best of" composite from multiple versions
   - [ ] Document the rationale for the final selection

**Output:** Scored comparison matrix with selection rationale

---

### Step 8: Conduct Cultural and Sensitivity Review (5-10 minutes)

Ensure the rewrite is appropriate across cultural and contextual dimensions:

1. **Cultural Sensitivity Check:**
   - [ ] Use Prompt 9 ("Check cultural sensitivity") on the selected version
   - [ ] Review for idioms or metaphors that may not translate across cultures
   - [ ] Check for assumptions about the reader's background or experience
   - [ ] Verify that humor (if any) is appropriate and unlikely to offend
   - [ ] Ensure gendered language is appropriate or neutral as required

2. **Context Appropriateness:**
   - [ ] Is the formality level correct for the communication channel?
   - [ ] Would this tone be appropriate if the text were forwarded or shared publicly?
   - [ ] Does the tone match the organizational culture of the intended recipient?
   - [ ] Are there any legal or compliance implications of the tone choices?

3. **Address Findings:**
   - [ ] Make targeted edits to address any sensitivity concerns
   - [ ] Re-run problematic sections through the AI with updated guidance
   - [ ] Document changes made for the audit trail

**Output:** Sensitivity-reviewed final version with change log

---

### Step 9: Finalize and Format (5-10 minutes)

Prepare the final deliverable:

1. **Final Polish:**
   - [ ] Run a grammar and spelling check (Grammarly or equivalent)
   - [ ] Verify all placeholder text has been replaced with actual content (or removed)
   - [ ] Ensure consistent formatting (headings, fonts, spacing)
   - [ ] Confirm the final word count meets requirements
   - [ ] Read the complete text one final time for flow and coherence

2. **Restore Redacted Content:**
   - [ ] Replace "[CLIENT_NAME]" and similar placeholders with actual values
   - [ ] Verify that restored content reads naturally within the rewritten text
   - [ ] Double-check that no placeholder markers remain in the final version

3. **Prepare Supporting Materials:**
   - [ ] Create a tone guide summary documenting the approach used
   - [ ] Save the comparison matrix for future reference
   - [ ] Archive all versions (not just the final) for the revision history

**Output:** Polished final draft ready for export

---

### Step 10: Export and Archive (5-10 minutes)

Deliver the final product and preserve the workflow:

1. **Export Deliverables:**
   - [ ] Export final draft as PDF (for distribution) and editable format (for future revisions)
   - [ ] Create tone guide sheet (spreadsheet or document) for ongoing reference
   - [ ] Package version comparison if stakeholder review is needed

2. **Archive Workflow:**
   - [ ] Save all versions in a dedicated project folder
   - [ ] Store the rewrite brief and tone specification for reuse
   - [ ] Log time spent and lessons learned
   - [ ] Update any team tone guides with new patterns discovered

3. **For Team/Batch Projects:**
   - [ ] Use Prompt 6 ("Team rewrite system") to set up collaborative guidelines
   - [ ] Use Prompt 10 ("Batch rewrite set") for multi-document projects
   - [ ] Distribute the tone guide to all team members
   - [ ] Schedule review checkpoints for multi-writer consistency

**Output:** Exported deliverables (Doc, Sheet, PDF) and archived workflow materials

## Best Practices

1. **Always Start with Analysis:** Never rewrite without first understanding the original tone, purpose, and audience; skipping assessment leads to inaccurate transformations
2. **Preserve Meaning First, Tone Second:** If you must compromise, always prioritize factual accuracy and intent over tonal perfection
3. **Iterate in Small Steps:** Make one targeted adjustment per iteration rather than requesting wholesale changes; this makes it easier to track what improved
4. **Use Real Examples:** Provide the AI with 2-3 sentences in your target tone as anchors; abstract tone labels ("formal") are interpreted differently by different models
5. **Read Aloud:** The quickest way to detect tone mismatches is to read the rewrite out loud; your ear catches what your eyes miss
6. **Track Every Version:** Never overwrite previous versions; version history is essential for comparison, client review, and learning
7. **Redact Before Rewriting:** Always sanitize sensitive content before submitting to any AI tool; tone can be adapted without exposing confidential details
8. **Test with the Target Audience:** When possible, have a representative of the target audience read the rewrite before finalizing
9. **Build Tone Libraries:** Save successful rewrites as reference examples for future projects; over time, this library becomes more valuable than any style guide
10. **Combine AI and Human Judgment:** Use AI for the heavy lifting of tone transformation but always apply human editorial judgment for nuance, cultural sensitivity, and brand alignment

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Tone Drift Across Sections:** The tone shifts between formal and casual within the same document
   - *Solution:* Rewrite section-by-section with the same prompt header, then review the full document for consistency

2. **Meaning Distortion:** The rewrite changes the factual content or reverses the original intent
   - *Solution:* Create a "meaning checklist" of key claims before rewriting and verify each one against the output

3. **Over-Formalizing or Over-Casualizing:** The rewrite goes too far in the target direction, sounding robotic (formal) or unprofessional (casual)
   - *Solution:* Use blended tone prompts (Prompt 5) and calibrate with real examples from the target context

4. **Ignoring Cultural Context:** A tone that works in one culture may be inappropriate in another
   - *Solution:* Always run a cultural sensitivity check (Step 8) and specify the audience's cultural context in the prompt

5. **Skipping Redaction:** Sensitive client or organizational data gets submitted to AI tools during rewriting
   - *Solution:* Make redaction a mandatory step (Step 3) with a checklist; never skip it regardless of urgency

6. **One-and-Done Mindset:** Accepting the first AI output without iteration
   - *Solution:* Plan for at least 2-3 iterations; the first output is a starting point, not a final product

7. **Inconsistent Team Voice:** Multiple team members rewrite in the same "tone" but produce noticeably different results
   - *Solution:* Create a shared tone guide with specific examples and use Prompt 6 to establish team conventions

8. **Neglecting the Original Author:** Rewriting someone else's work without understanding their intent can introduce errors
   - *Solution:* When possible, consult the original author about key messages and non-negotiable phrasing before rewriting

## Time Estimates

- **Single Tone Rewrite (simple text):** 20-30 minutes
- **Multi-Tone Comparison (2-3 versions):** 45-60 minutes
- **Full Workflow (assessment through export):** 60-90 minutes
- **Batch Rewrite (5-10 documents, same tone):** 2-3 hours
- **Team Tone Guide Creation:** 1-2 hours (one-time investment)
