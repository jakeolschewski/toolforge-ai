REDACTION GUIDE - TONE-ADAPTIVE REWRITE SYSTEM
================================================

PURPOSE
-------
This guide ensures that all text submitted for AI-assisted tone rewriting has been
properly redacted of sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information.
Tone transformation does not require real names, figures, or proprietary details --
placeholders work equally well and protect your data.

=============================================================================
SECTION 1: TYPES OF DATA TO REDACT
=============================================================================

CATEGORY A: PERSONAL IDENTIFIERS (NEVER INCLUDE)
-------------------------------------------------
x ABSOLUTELY NEVER INCLUDE:
  - Full names of employees, clients, customers, or partners
  - Email addresses or phone numbers
  - Physical addresses or location details
  - Social Security numbers, national IDs, or passport numbers
  - Employee IDs, badge numbers, or internal usernames
  - Photographs or physical descriptions of identifiable individuals
  - Birthdates or age-specific references tied to named individuals

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "[EMPLOYEE_NAME]" or "[CLIENT_NAME]" instead of real names
  - "[CONTACT_EMAIL]" instead of actual email addresses
  - "a team member" or "the project lead" instead of named individuals
  - "[CITY]" or "[REGION]" instead of specific locations
  - "Employee in [DEPARTMENT]" instead of identifying details


CATEGORY B: FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS DATA
----------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Revenue figures, profit margins, or budget amounts
  - Contract values, pricing structures, or discount rates
  - Salary information or compensation details
  - Client billing rates or project costs
  - Investor details or funding amounts
  - Quarterly or annual financial performance data
  - Vendor pricing or negotiated rates

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "[REVENUE_FIGURE]" or "[BUDGET_AMOUNT]" for specific numbers
  - "significant growth" instead of "43% year-over-year increase"
  - "[CONTRACT_VALUE]" instead of actual dollar amounts
  - "competitive compensation" instead of specific salary figures
  - Ranges: "mid-six-figure contract" instead of "$450,000"


CATEGORY C: PROPRIETARY AND STRATEGIC INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------
x BE CAUTIOUS WITH:
  - Product names before public announcement
  - Strategic plans or roadmaps not yet disclosed
  - Patent applications or trade secrets
  - Competitive intelligence or market analysis
  - Internal process documentation with unique methodologies
  - Partnership or acquisition discussions
  - Customer lists or segmentation strategies

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "[PRODUCT_NAME]" or "upcoming product" instead of real names
  - "strategic initiative" instead of specific plan details
  - "[PROPRIETARY_PROCESS]" for unique methodologies
  - Generic descriptions: "our main competitor" instead of naming them
  - "market expansion plan" instead of specific geographic targets


CATEGORY D: COMMUNICATION CONTEXT
-----------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY REVEALING:
  - Internal email thread contents with identifying details
  - Meeting transcripts with participant names
  - Chat logs from internal messaging platforms
  - Performance review language tied to specific individuals
  - Customer complaint specifics that could identify the customer
  - Legal correspondence or dispute details
  - HR-related communications (disciplinary, accommodation, etc.)

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - Paraphrase the message content without identifying details
  - "[MEETING_PARTICIPANT]" instead of attendee names
  - "A customer reported [GENERAL_ISSUE]" instead of verbatim complaints
  - Remove thread context; provide only the text needing tone adaptation
  - "Internal feedback" instead of specific performance language
  - "[LEGAL_MATTER]" for any legal references


CATEGORY E: ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------
x POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE:
  - Specific department names if they reveal strategy (e.g., "M&A Team")
  - Reporting structures that could identify individuals
  - Internal project codenames
  - Office locations with small headcounts (identifying by elimination)
  - Org chart details
  - Contractor or vendor company names (if relationship is confidential)

v SAFE ALTERNATIVES:
  - "the marketing team" instead of "the Digital Transformation Unit"
  - "[DEPARTMENT]" for sensitive team names
  - "[PROJECT_CODENAME]" instead of actual internal names
  - "our [CITY] office" or simply "a regional office"
  - Generic roles: "senior leadership" instead of specific titles that identify

=============================================================================
SECTION 2: STEP-BY-STEP REDACTION PROCESS
=============================================================================

STEP 1: PRE-REDACTION REVIEW
-----------------------------
Before submitting any text for tone rewriting:

[ ] Read the entire text and identify all categories of sensitive data present
[ ] Determine the minimum context needed for accurate tone adaptation
[ ] Note which details are essential for tone (e.g., "apology" context matters)
    vs. which are incidental (e.g., exact dollar amounts do not affect tone)
[ ] Identify any sections that should NOT be rewritten at all
    (legal disclaimers, regulatory language, direct quotes with attribution)

STEP 2: NAME AND IDENTITY REPLACEMENT
---------------------------------------
Replace all personal identifiers systematically:

Names:
  x BEFORE: "Please inform Sarah Chen in the Portland office that the Johnson
             contract needs revision."
  v AFTER:  "Please inform [EMPLOYEE_NAME] in the [CITY] office that the
             [CLIENT_NAME] contract needs revision."

Titles (if identifying):
  x BEFORE: "The VP of Engineering reviewed the proposal."
  v AFTER:  "A senior leader reviewed the proposal."
            OR: "[TITLE] reviewed the proposal."

Contact Information:
  x BEFORE: "Reach out to support@acmecorp.com or call 555-0142."
  v AFTER:  "Reach out to [SUPPORT_EMAIL] or call [PHONE_NUMBER]."

STEP 3: FINANCIAL DATA SANITIZATION
-------------------------------------
Replace specific figures with placeholders or ranges:

Revenue/Cost:
  x BEFORE: "Q3 revenue reached $4.2M, up 23% from Q2."
  v AFTER:  "Q3 revenue reached [REVENUE_FIGURE], up [PERCENTAGE] from Q2."
       OR:  "Quarterly revenue showed significant growth over the prior quarter."

Pricing:
  x BEFORE: "The premium tier costs $299/month with a 15% annual discount."
  v AFTER:  "The premium tier costs [PRICE]/month with a [DISCOUNT]% annual discount."

Salary/Compensation:
  x BEFORE: "The offer includes a $125K base salary plus $20K signing bonus."
  v AFTER:  "The offer includes a [SALARY] base salary plus [BONUS] signing bonus."

STEP 4: CONTEXT PRESERVATION WITHOUT EXPOSURE
-----------------------------------------------
Maintain enough context for accurate tone adaptation while removing specifics:

Business Context:
  x BEFORE: "Following our acquisition of DataStream Analytics last quarter, we need
             to communicate the integration timeline to their 47 employees in Austin."
  v AFTER:  "Following a recent business transition, we need to communicate the
             integration timeline to [NUMBER] employees in [LOCATION]."
       OR:  "Following [BUSINESS_EVENT], we need to communicate the integration
             timeline to affected team members."

Customer Situation:
  x BEFORE: "Mrs. Patricia Williams (account #4829301) has filed three complaints
             about delivery delays to her Scottsdale residence this month."
  v AFTER:  "A long-term customer has filed multiple complaints about delivery
             delays this month."

STEP 5: STRUCTURAL REDACTION FOR LONG DOCUMENTS
-------------------------------------------------
For multi-page documents requiring tone adaptation:

[ ] Redact each section independently (do not assume prior sections provide context)
[ ] Add inline context notes where redaction removes important background:
    "[Note: This paragraph refers to a delayed product launch]"
[ ] Mark sections that should be skipped: "[DO NOT REWRITE - Legal Disclaimer]"
[ ] Number all paragraphs for easy reference during comparison
[ ] If document structure itself is sensitive (e.g., M&A due diligence format),
    restructure before submitting

STEP 6: METADATA AND FILE PROPERTY SCRUBBING
----------------------------------------------
Before uploading files to any AI tool:

[ ] Check document properties (author name, organization, creation date)
[ ] Remove tracked changes and comments that contain sensitive information
[ ] Strip hidden metadata from PDFs (creator, keywords, subject fields)
[ ] Remove embedded objects (images, charts) that may contain identifying data
[ ] Check headers and footers for confidential markings or project names
[ ] Verify file name does not contain sensitive identifiers
    x "AcmeCorp-Layoff-Communication-Draft.docx"
    v "tone-rewrite-internal-announcement-draft.docx"

STEP 7: FINAL REDACTION VERIFICATION
--------------------------------------
Before submitting the redacted text to any AI tool:

[ ] Search for all personal names mentioned in the original (Ctrl+F each one)
[ ] Search for "@" to catch any remaining email addresses
[ ] Search for "$" and number patterns to catch remaining financial data
[ ] Search for phone number patterns (###-####, (###) ###-####)
[ ] Search for your organization's domain name
[ ] Read the redacted version as if you were an outsider -- does it reveal anything?
[ ] Have a second person review if the content is highly sensitive
[ ] Confirm that the redacted version still provides enough context for tone adaptation

=============================================================================

=============================================================================
SECTION 4: AUTOMATED REDACTION TOOLS
=============================================================================

FIND-AND-REPLACE APPROACH (MANUAL)
-----------------------------------
For quick redaction in any word processor:

1. Create a list of all names, numbers, and identifiers in the original
2. Use Find & Replace to swap each one:
   - Find: "Sarah Chen"  -->  Replace: "[EMPLOYEE_NAME_1]"
   - Find: "$4.2M"      -->  Replace: "[REVENUE_FIGURE]"
   - Find: "Portland"   -->  Replace: "[CITY]"
3. Do a final search for any remaining instances

REGEX PATTERNS (FOR TECHNICAL USERS)
-------------------------------------
Common patterns to search and replace:

Email addresses:
  sed -E 's/[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}/[EMAIL_REDACTED]/g' file.txt

Phone numbers (US):
  sed -E 's/(\+?1[-.]?)?\(?[0-9]{3}\)?[-. ]?[0-9]{3}[-. ]?[0-9]{4}/[PHONE_REDACTED]/g' file.txt

Dollar amounts:
  sed -E 's/\$[0-9,]+(\.[0-9]{2})?/[AMOUNT_REDACTED]/g' file.txt

Dates (MM/DD/YYYY):
  sed -E 's/[0-9]{1,2}\/[0-9]{1,2}\/[0-9]{2,4}/[DATE_REDACTED]/g' file.txt

PII DETECTION TOOLS
---------------------
For more thorough automated redaction:

1. Microsoft Presidio (open source, Python):
   - Detects names, emails, phone numbers, credit cards, and more
   - Customizable entity recognition
   - Integrates with Python scripts for batch processing

2. Google Cloud DLP (Data Loss Prevention):
   - API-based PII detection and redaction
   - Supports custom info types
   - Enterprise-grade but requires Google Cloud account

3. AWS Comprehend (PII Detection):
   - Identifies PII entities in text
   - Can auto-redact before processing
   - Pay-per-use pricing

MANUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED
------------------------------
Automated tools miss context-dependent sensitivity:
- Industry jargon that reveals trade secrets
- Combinations of generic details that identify someone
- Strategic information embedded in casual language
- Tone-specific phrases that hint at confidential situations

Always manually review after any automated redaction pass.

=============================================================================
SECTION 5: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

Before submitting any text for AI-assisted tone rewriting:

[ ] All personal names replaced with role-based or numbered placeholders
[ ] All email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses removed
[ ] All financial figures replaced with placeholders or generic descriptions
[ ] Proprietary product names, project codenames, and strategy details removed
[ ] Customer-identifying information fully anonymized
[ ] Internal reference numbers (case IDs, ticket numbers, account numbers) removed
[ ] Organization name and domain removed (unless public and non-sensitive)
[ ] Document metadata scrubbed (author, organization, comments, tracked changes)
[ ] File name does not contain sensitive identifiers
[ ] Redacted version still provides sufficient context for accurate tone adaptation
[ ] Sections not requiring rewriting clearly marked as excluded
[ ] Second person has reviewed the redacted version (for high-sensitivity content)

PEER REVIEW:
[ ] Reviewer confirmed no personally identifiable information remains
[ ] Reviewer confirmed no financial data or business metrics remain
[ ] Reviewer confirmed context is sufficient for the AI to perform tone adaptation

=============================================================================
SECTION 6: SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
=============================================================================

TONE-SPECIFIC REDACTION CHALLENGES
------------------------------------
Tone adaptation sometimes requires emotional or situational context that
overlaps with sensitive information. Handle these carefully:

Empathetic Rewrites:
- The AI needs to know the emotional context (bad news, apology, sympathy)
- Provide the type of situation without specifics:
  v "This is an apology for a significant service failure"
  x "This apologizes to John Martinez for the 3-day outage on his account"

Formal/Legal Rewrites:
- Legal terminology may need to remain unchanged
- Mark legal phrases as "[DO NOT REWRITE]" within the text
- Consult legal counsel if adapting legally binding language

Persuasive Rewrites:
- Sales figures and case studies add persuasive power
- Use anonymized versions: "a Fortune 500 client" instead of the actual name
- Replace specific ROI figures with ranges or categories

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
-----------------------
GDPR: All personal data of EU residents must be redacted before AI processing.
       This includes names, locations, and any data that could identify an individual.
HIPAA: Never include any protected health information, even in paraphrased form.
       Medical contexts should use only generic descriptions.
FERPA: Student records and educational information must be fully anonymized.
CCPA: California consumer personal information requires redaction.
SOX: Financial data subject to Sarbanes-Oxley should not be processed externally.

WHEN IN DOUBT
--------------
When in doubt about whether something needs redaction: REDACT IT.
Over-redaction is always safer than under-redaction.
You can always restore real details in the final version after tone adaptation
is complete and the AI-generated content is safely on your local system.

POST-REWRITE RESTORATION
--------------------------
After the AI returns the rewritten text:
1. Review the output for quality and tone accuracy
2. Replace placeholders with actual values ONLY in your local copy
3. Never send the restored (un-redacted) version back to the AI
4. Store the final un-redacted version in a secure location
5. Delete any AI chat history that contained even redacted versions
   of sensitive communications (if organizational policy requires)

=============================================================================
SUPPORT & QUESTIONS
=============================================================================

For sensitive situations, consult:
- Legal team before rewriting contractual or regulatory language
- HR team before rewriting employee-related communications
- Compliance team before processing data from regulated industries
- Information security before using new AI tools for tone adaptation

This guide is for educational purposes. Adapt redaction practices to your
organization's specific security policies and regulatory requirements.
